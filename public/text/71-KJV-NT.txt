Book 40        Matthew

40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
           the son of Abraham.

40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
           Judas and his brethren;

40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
           Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
           Naasson begat Salmon;

40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
           and Obed begat Jesse;

40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
           Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
           begat Asa;

40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
           begat Ozias;

40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
           begat Ezekias;

40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
           begat Josias;

40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
           they were carried away to Babylon:

40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
           Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
           Eliakim begat Azor;

40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
           Eliud;

40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
           Matthan begat Jacob;

40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
           Jesus, who is called Christ.

40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
           generations; and from David until the carrying away into
           Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
           into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
           mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
           she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
           make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
           privily.

40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
           LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
           David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
           which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
           JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
           spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
           son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
           interpreted is, God with us.

40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
           Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
           and he called his name JESUS.

40:002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
           Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
           Jerusalem,

40:002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
           seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

40:002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
           and all Jerusalem with him.

40:002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
           the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
           be born.

40:002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
           written by the prophet,

40:002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
           among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
           Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

40:002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
           of them diligently what time the star appeared.

40:002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
           diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
           bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

40:002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
           star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
           came and stood over where the young child was.

40:002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
           joy.

40:002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
           child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
           and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
           him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

40:002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
           to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

40:002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
           appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
           young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
           there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
           child to destroy him.

40:002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
           night, and departed into Egypt:

40:002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
           fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
           Out of Egypt have I called my son.

40:002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
           was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
           that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
           two years old and under, according to the time which he had
           diligently enquired of the wise men.

40:002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
           prophet, saying,

40:002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
           great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
           be comforted, because they are not.

40:002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
           appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

40:002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
           into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
           young child's life.

40:002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
           came into the land of Israel.

40:002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
           room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
           notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
           aside into the parts of Galilee:

40:002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
           be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
           called a Nazarene.

40:003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
           wilderness of Judaea,

40:003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

40:003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
           saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
           the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

40:003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
           leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
           wild honey.

40:003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
           region round about Jordan,

40:003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

40:003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
           his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
           hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

40:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

40:003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
           father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
           to raise up children unto Abraham.

40:003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
           therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
           hewn down, and cast into the fire.

40:003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
           cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
           worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
           with fire:

40:003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
           floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
           up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

40:003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
           baptized of him.

40:003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
           thee, and comest thou to me?

40:003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
           thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
           suffered him.

40:003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
           the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
           saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
           upon him:

40:003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
           whom I am well pleased.

40:004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
           tempted of the devil.

40:004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
           afterward an hungred.

40:004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
           of God, command that these stones be made bread.

40:004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
           bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
           mouth of God.

40:004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
           him on a pinnacle of the temple,

40:004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
           down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
           concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
           lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

40:004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
           the Lord thy God.

40:004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
           mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
           the glory of them;

40:004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
           wilt fall down and worship me.

40:004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
           written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
           shalt thou serve.

40:004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
           ministered unto him.

40:004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
           departed into Galilee;

40:004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
           upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

40:004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying,

40:004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
           the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

40:004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
           which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
           up.

40:004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
           the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

40:004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
           Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
           the sea: for they were fishers.

40:004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
           of men.

40:004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

40:004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
           their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

40:004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
           followed him.

40:004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
           synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
           healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
           the people.

40:004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
           him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
           torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
           those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
           he healed them.

40:004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from
           Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
           Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

40:005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
           when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

40:005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

40:005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
           heaven.

40:005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

40:005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

40:005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
           righteousness: for they shall be filled.

40:005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

40:005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

40:005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
           children of God.

40:005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
           for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

40:005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
           and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
           sake.

40:005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
           heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
           you.

40:005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
           savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
           for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
           of men.

40:005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
           cannot be hid.

40:005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
           on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
           house.

40:005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
           good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

40:005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
           I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

40:005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
           or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
           fulfilled.

40:005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
           commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
           least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
           teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
           heaven.

40:005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
           exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
           shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

40:005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
           not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
           judgment:

40:005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
           without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
           whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
           of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
           in danger of hell fire.

40:005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
           rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

40:005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
           be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
           gift.

40:005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
           with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
           judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
           cast into prison.

40:005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
           thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

40:005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
           not commit adultery:

40:005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
           after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
           heart.

40:005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
           from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
           members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
           cast into hell.

40:005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
           from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
           members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
           cast into hell.

40:005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
           give her a writing of divorcement:

40:005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,
           saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
           adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
           committeth adultery.

40:005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
           time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
           the Lord thine oaths:

40:005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for
           it is God's throne:

40:005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
           Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

40:005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
           make one hair white or black.

40:005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
           whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

40:005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
           tooth for a tooth:

40:005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
           shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
           also.

40:005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
           coat, let him have thy cloak also.

40:005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
           twain.

40:005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
           of thee turn not thou away.

40:005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

40:005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
           you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
           despitefully use you, and persecute you;

40:005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
           for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
           sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

40:005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
           not even the publicans the same?

40:005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
           others? do not even the publicans so?

40:005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
           heaven is perfect.

40:006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
           them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
           heaven.

40:006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
           before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
           streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto
           you, They have their reward.

40:006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
           right hand doeth:

40:006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
           in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

40:006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
           are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
           the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
           Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

40:006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
           thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
           secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
           openly.

40:006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
           for they think that they shall be heard for their much
           speaking.

40:006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
           what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

40:006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
           heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

40:006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
           heaven.

40:006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

40:006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

40:006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
           thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
           Amen.

40:006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
           will also forgive you:

40:006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
           Father forgive your trespasses.

40:006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
           countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
           appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
           their reward.

40:006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
           face;

40:006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
           which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
           shall reward thee openly.

40:006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
           rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

40:006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
           moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
           through nor steal:

40:006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

40:006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
           single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

40:006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
           darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
           how great is that darkness!

40:006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
           and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
           despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

40:006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
           ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
           what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
           body than raiment?

40:006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
           reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
           them. Are ye not much better than they?

40:006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
           stature?

40:006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
           the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

40:006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was
           not arrayed like one of these.

40:006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
           day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
           more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

40:006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
           shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

40:006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
           heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

40:006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
           and all these things shall be added unto you.

40:006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
           take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
           is the evil thereof.

40:007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

40:007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with
           what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

40:007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
           but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

40:007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
           out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

40:007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
           and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
           thy brother's eye.

40:007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
           your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
           feet, and turn again and rend you.

40:007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
           knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

40:007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
           findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

40:007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
           he give him a stone?

40:007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

40:007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
           children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
           give good things to them that ask him?

40:007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
           you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
           prophets.

40:007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
           broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
           be which go in thereat:

40:007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
           leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

40:007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
           clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

40:007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
           thorns, or figs of thistles?

40:007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
           corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

40:007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
           corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

40:007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
           and cast into the fire.

40:007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

40:007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
           the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
           which is in heaven.

40:007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
           prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?
           and in thy name done many wonderful works?

40:007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
           from me, ye that work iniquity.

40:007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
           them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
           upon a rock:

40:007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
           blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
           founded upon a rock.

40:007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
           them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
           house upon the sand:

40:007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
           blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
           fall of it.

40:007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
           people were astonished at his doctrine:

40:007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
           scribes.

40:008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
           followed him.

40:008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
           Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

40:008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
           be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

40:008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
           way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
           commanded, for a testimony unto them.

40:008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him
           a centurion, beseeching him,

40:008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
           grievously tormented.

40:008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

40:008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
           thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,
           and my servant shall be healed.

40:008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
           I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
           he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

40:008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
           followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great
           faith, no, not in Israel.

40:008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
           west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
           in the kingdom of heaven.

40:008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
           darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
           hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was
           healed in the selfsame hour.

40:008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
           mother laid, and sick of a fever.

40:008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
           arose, and ministered unto them.

40:008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
           possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his
           word, and healed all that were sick:

40:008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
           sicknesses.

40:008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
           commandment to depart unto the other side.

40:008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
           follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

40:008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
           of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
           lay his head.

40:008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
           first to go and bury my father.

40:008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
           their dead.

40:008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
           him.

40:008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
           that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

40:008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
           save us: we perish.

40:008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
           faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
           there was a great calm.

40:008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
           that even the winds and the sea obey him!

40:008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
           Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
           out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
           by that way.

40:008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
           thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment
           us before the time?

40:008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
           feeding.

40:008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
           suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

40:008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
           went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
           swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
           perished in the waters.

40:008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
           city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
           possessed of the devils.

40:008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
           they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
           their coasts.

40:009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
           own city.

40:009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
           lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
           sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
           thee.

40:009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
           This man blasphemeth.

40:009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
           in your hearts?

40:009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
           to say, Arise, and walk?

40:009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
           to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
           Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

40:009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

40:009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
           God, which had given such power unto men.

40:009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
           Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
           him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

40:009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
           behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
           and his disciples.

40:009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
           Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

40:009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
           whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

40:009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
           not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
           sinners to repentance.

40:009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and
           the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

40:009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
           mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
           will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and
           then shall they fast.

40:009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
           that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
           and the rent is made worse.

40:009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
           break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but
           they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

40:009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
           certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
           now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
           live.

40:009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

40:009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
           blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of
           his garment:

40:009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
           shall be whole.

40:009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
           Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
           And the woman was made whole from that hour.

40:009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
           minstrels and the people making a noise,

40:009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
           sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

40:009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
           by the hand, and the maid arose.

40:009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

40:009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
           crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

40:009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to
           him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to
           do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

40:009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
           it unto you.

40:009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
           saying, See that no man know it.

40:009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
           all that country.

40:009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
           possessed with a devil.

40:009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
           multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

40:009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
           prince of the devils.

40:009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
           their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
           healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

40:009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
           on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
           sheep having no shepherd.

40:009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
           plenteous, but the labourers are few;

40:009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
           forth labourers into his harvest.

40:010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
           them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
           heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

40:010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
           Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

40:010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
           James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was
           Thaddaeus;

40:010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
           him.

40:010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
           not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
           Samaritans enter ye not:

40:010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

40:010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
           hand.

40:010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
           devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

40:010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

40:010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
           nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

40:010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
           in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

40:010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

40:010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
           if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

40:010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
           ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
           your feet.

40:010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
           of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
           city.

40:010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
           ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

40:010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
           councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

40:010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
           sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

40:010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
           shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
           ye shall speak.

40:010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
           which speaketh in you.

40:010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
           father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
           parents, and cause them to be put to death.

40:010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
           that endureth to the end shall be saved.

40:010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
           another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone
           over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

40:010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
           his lord.

40:010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
           the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
           house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
           household?

40:010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
           shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

40:010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
           ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

40:010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
           kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
           both soul and body in hell.

40:010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
           shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

40:010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

40:010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
           sparrows.

40:010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
           confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

40:010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
           before my Father which is in heaven.

40:010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
           send peace, but a sword.

40:010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
           the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
           against her mother in law.

40:010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

40:010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
           me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
           worthy of me.

40:010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
           not worthy of me.

40:010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
           life for my sake shall find it.

40:010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
           receiveth him that sent me.

40:010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
           receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
           man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
           man's reward.

40:010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
           ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
           verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

40:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
           his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
           preach in their cities.

40:011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
           sent two of his disciples,

40:011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
           for another?

40:011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again
           those things which ye do hear and see:

40:011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
           are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
           the poor have the gospel preached to them.

40:011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

40:011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
           concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
           A reed shaken with the wind?

40:011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
           raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
           houses.

40:011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
           you, and more than a prophet.

40:011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
           messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
           thee.

40:011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
           hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
           notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
           greater than he.

40:011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
           heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

40:011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

40:011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
           come.

40:011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
           children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
           fellows,

40:011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
           have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

40:011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
           hath a devil.

40:011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold
           a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
           sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

40:011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
           works were done, because they repented not:

40:011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
           mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
           and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
           ashes.

40:011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
           Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

40:011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
           brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
           done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
           until this day.

40:011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
           land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

40:011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
           Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
           from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

40:011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

40:011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
           knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
           Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
           him.

40:011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
           will give you rest.

40:011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
           lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

40:011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

40:012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
           and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears
           of corn and to eat.

40:012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
           disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
           day.

40:012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
           he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

40:012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
           shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
           them which were with him, but only for the priests?

40:012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
           the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
           blameless?

40:012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
           temple.

40:012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
           not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

40:012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

40:012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

40:012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
           they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
           days? that they might accuse him.

40:012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
           shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
           day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

40:012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
           lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

40:012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
           stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
           other.

40:012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
           how they might destroy him.

40:012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
           great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

40:012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

40:012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
           prophet, saying,

40:012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
           soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
           shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

40:012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
           voice in the streets.

40:012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
           not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

40:012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

40:012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
           and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
           both spake and saw.

40:012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
           of David?

40:012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
           not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
           devils.

40:012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
           kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
           every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

40:012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
           how shall then his kingdom stand?

40:012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
           children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

40:012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
           kingdom of God is come unto you.

40:012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
           his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
           will spoil his house.

40:012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
           not with me scattereth abroad.

40:012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
           shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
           Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

40:012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
           be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
           Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
           neither in the world to come.

40:012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make
           the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known
           by his fruit.

40:012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
           things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
           speaketh.

40:012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
           forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
           bringeth forth evil things.

40:012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
           they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

40:012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
           thou shalt be condemned.

40:012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
           saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

40:012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
           generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
           given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

40:012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
           belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
           in the heart of the earth.

40:012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
           preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

40:012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
           uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
           and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

40:012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
           through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

40:012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
           out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
           garnished.

40:012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
           more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
           and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
           so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

40:012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
           brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

40:012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
           stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

40:012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
           mother? and who are my brethren?

40:012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
           said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

40:012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
           heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

40:013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
           side.

40:013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
           he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
           the shore.

40:013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
           Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

40:013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
           fowls came and devoured them up:

40:013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
           and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
           earth:

40:013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
           had no root, they withered away.

40:013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
           choked them:

40:013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
           an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

40:013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
           unto them in parables?

40:013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
           to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
           is not given.

40:013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
           more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
           taken away even that he hath.

40:013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
           not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

40:013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
           By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
           ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

40:013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
           dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
           time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
           and should understand with their heart, and should be
           converted, and I should heal them.

40:013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
           they hear.

40:013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
           men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
           not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
           have not heard them.

40:013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

40:013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
           understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth
           away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which
           received seed by the way side.

40:013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
           he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

40:013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for
           when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
           by and by he is offended.

40:013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
           the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of
           riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

40:013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
           heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
           fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
           some thirty.

40:013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
           heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
           field:

40:013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
           wheat, and went his way.

40:013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
           then appeared the tares also.

40:013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
           Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
           then hath it tares?

40:013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
           unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

40:013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
           up also the wheat with them.

40:013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
           harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
           the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
           the wheat into my barn.

40:013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
           heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
           and sowed in his field:

40:013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,
           it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that
           the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

40:013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
           like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
           measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

40:013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
           and without a parable spake he not unto them:

40:013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
           saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
           which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

40:013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
           and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
           parable of the tares of the field.

40:013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
           is the Son of man;

40:013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
           kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

40:013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
           of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40:013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
           shall it be in the end of this world.

40:013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
           gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
           which do iniquity;

40:013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
           wailing and gnashing of teeth.

40:013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
           of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

40:013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
           field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
           thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
           field.

40:013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
           seeking goodly pearls:

40:013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
           all that he had, and bought it.

40:013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
           into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

40:013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
           gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

40:013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
           forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

40:013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
           wailing and gnashing of teeth.

40:013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
           They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

40:013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
           instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
           is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
           things new and old.

40:013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
           parables, he departed thence.

40:013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
           their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
           Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

40:013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
           Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and
           Judas?

40:013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath
           this man all these things?

40:013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
           prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
           his own house.

40:013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
           unbelief.

40:014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

40:014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
           risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth
           themselves in him.

40:014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
           prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

40:014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

40:014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
           multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

40:014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
           danced before them, and pleased Herod.

40:014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
           would ask.

40:014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
           here John Baptist's head in a charger.

40:014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
           them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
           her.

40:014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

40:014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
           damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

40:014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
           and went and told Jesus.

40:014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a
           desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,
           they followed him on foot out of the cities.

40:014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
           with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

40:014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
           This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
           multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
           themselves victuals.

40:014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
           to eat.

40:014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
           fishes.

40:014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

40:014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
           took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
           heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
           disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

40:014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

40:014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
           women and children.

40:014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
           ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
           the multitudes away.

40:014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
           mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
           there alone.

40:014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
           waves: for the wind was contrary.

40:014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
           walking on the sea.

40:014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
           troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

40:014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
           cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

40:014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
           come unto thee on the water.

40:014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
           ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

40:014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
           beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

40:014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught
           him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
           didst thou doubt?

40:014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

40:014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
           saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

40:014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
           Gennesaret.

40:014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
           out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
           all that were diseased;

40:014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
           garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

40:015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
           Jerusalem, saying,

40:015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
           for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

40:015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
           the commandment of God by your tradition?

40:015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
           He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

40:015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
           It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

40:015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
           Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by
           your tradition.

40:015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

40:015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
           honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

40:015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
           commandments of men.

40:015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
           understand:

40:015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
           which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

40:015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
           the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

40:015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
           Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

40:015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
           blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

40:015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
           parable.

40:015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

40:015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
           mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

40:015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
           from the heart; and they defile the man.

40:015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
           adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

40:015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
           unwashen hands defileth not a man.

40:015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
           and Sidon.

40:015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
           and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
           of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

40:015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
           besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

40:015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
           sheep of the house of Israel.

40:015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

40:015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
           children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

40:015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
           which fall from their masters' table.

40:015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
           faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
           made whole from that very hour.

40:015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
           Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

40:015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those
           that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
           them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

40:015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
           to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
           blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

40:015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
           compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
           three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
           away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

40:015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
           bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

40:015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
           said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

40:015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

40:015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
           and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples
           to the multitude.

40:015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

40:015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
           children.

40:015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
           the coasts of Magdala.

40:016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
           desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

40:016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
           will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

40:016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the
           sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
           face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the
           times?

40:016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
           there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
           prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

40:016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
           forgotten to take bread.

40:016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
           of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

40:016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
           have taken no bread.

40:016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
           faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
           no bread?

40:016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
           the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

40:016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
           baskets ye took up?

40:016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
           concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
           Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

40:016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
           leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
           the Sadducees.

40:016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
           his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
           am?

40:016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
           Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

40:016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

40:016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
           Son of the living God.

40:016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
           Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
           but my Father which is in heaven.

40:016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
           rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
           prevail against it.

40:016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
           and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
           heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
           loosed in heaven.

40:016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
           that he was Jesus the Christ.

40:016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
           how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
           the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
           be raised again the third day.

40:016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
           far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

40:016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
           thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
           that be of God, but those that be of men.

40:016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
           me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
           me.

40:016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
           will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

40:016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
           and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
           for his soul?

40:016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
           his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
           his works.

40:016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
           shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
           in his kingdom.

40:017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
           brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

40:017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
           the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

40:017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
           with him.

40:017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for
           us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
           tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
           Elias.

40:017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
           and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
           beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

40:017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
           were sore afraid.

40:017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
           afraid.

40:017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
           Jesus only.

40:017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
           saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be
           risen again from the dead.

40:017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
           that Elias must first come?

40:017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
           come, and restore all things.

40:017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
           him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
           Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

40:017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
           the Baptist.

40:017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
           certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

40:017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
           vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
           water.

40:017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
           him.

40:017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
           generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
           suffer you? bring him hither to me.

40:017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
           the child was cured from that very hour.

40:017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
           not we cast him out?

40:017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
           I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
           ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;
           and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

40:017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

40:017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
           of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

40:017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised
           again. And they were exceeding sorry.

40:017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
           tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
           pay tribute?

40:017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
           prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do
           the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own
           children, or of strangers?

40:017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then
           are the children free.

40:017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
           sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
           up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
           piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

40:018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
           the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

40:018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
           midst of them,

40:018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
           become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
           of heaven.

40:018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
           the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

40:018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
           receiveth me.

40:018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
           in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
           about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
           sea.

40:018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
           that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
           cometh!

40:018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
           and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
           life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
           to be cast into everlasting fire.

40:018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
           thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
           rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

40:018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
           say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
           face of my Father which is in heaven.

40:018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

40:018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
           be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
           goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
           astray?

40:018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
           rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine
           which went not astray.

40:018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
           that one of these little ones should perish.

40:018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
           tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
           hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

40:018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
           more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
           may be established.

40:018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
           but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
           an heathen man and a publican.

40:018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
           be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
           shall be loosed in heaven.

40:018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
           as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
           for them of my Father which is in heaven.

40:018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
           am I in the midst of them.

40:018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
           brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

40:018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
           but, Until seventy times seven.

40:018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
           king, which would take account of his servants.

40:018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
           which owed him ten thousand talents.

40:018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to
           be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
           payment to be made.

40:018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
           Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

40:018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
           loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

40:018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
           fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid
           hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
           thou owest.

40:018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
           saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

40:018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
           should pay the debt.

40:018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
           sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

40:018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
           thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
           thou desiredst me:

40:018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
           fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

40:018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
           till he should pay all that was due unto him.

40:018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
           from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
           trespasses.

40:019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
           sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
           Judaea beyond Jordan;

40:019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

40:019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
           unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
           every cause?

40:019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
           which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

40:019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
           and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
           flesh?

40:019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
           therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

40:019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a
           writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

40:019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your
           hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
           beginning it was not so.

40:019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
           it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
           adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
           adultery.

40:019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
           his wife, it is not good to marry.

40:019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
           save they to whom it is given.

40:019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
           mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
           eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
           themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that
           is able to receive it, let him receive it.

40:019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he
           should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples
           rebuked them.

40:019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
           to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

40:019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

40:019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
           good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

40:019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
           good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
           keep the commandments.

40:019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
           Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
           shalt not bear false witness,

40:019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour as thyself.

40:019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
           from my youth up: what lack I yet?

40:019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
           thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
           in heaven: and come and follow me.

40:019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
           sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

40:019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
           That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

40:019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
           through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
           the kingdom of God.

40:019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
           saying, Who then can be saved?

40:019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
           impossible; but with God all things are possible.

40:019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have
           forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

40:019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
           have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
           shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
           twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

40:019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
           sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
           for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
           inherit everlasting life.

40:019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
           first.

40:020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
           householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
           labourers into his vineyard.

40:020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
           he sent them into his vineyard.

40:020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
           idle in the marketplace,

40:020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
           whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

40:020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
           likewise.

40:020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
           standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the
           day idle?

40:020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
           them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
           that shall ye receive.

40:020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
           steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
           beginning from the last unto the first.

40:020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
           they received every man a penny.

40:020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
           received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

40:020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
           goodman of the house,

40:020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
           made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
           of the day.

40:020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
           wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

40:020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
           last, even as unto thee.

40:020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
           thine eye evil, because I am good?

40:020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
           called, but few chosen.

40:020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
           apart in the way, and said unto them,

40:020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
           betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
           shall condemn him to death,

40:020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
           and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

40:020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her
           sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

40:020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
           Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
           hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

40:020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
           able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
           baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say
           unto him, We are able.

40:020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
           be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
           sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
           it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
           Father.

40:020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
           against the two brethren.

40:020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
           princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
           that are great exercise authority upon them.

40:020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
           among you, let him be your minister;

40:020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
           servant:

40:020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
           minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

40:020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
           him.

40:020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
           heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
           us, O Lord, thou son of David.

40:020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
           peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
           Lord, thou son of David.

40:020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
           that I shall do unto you?

40:020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

40:020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
           immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

40:021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
           Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
           disciples,

40:021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
           straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
           loose them, and bring them unto me.

40:021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
           need of them; and straightway he will send them.

40:021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
           by the prophet, saying,

40:021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
           thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
           ass.

40:021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

40:021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
           clothes, and they set him thereon.

40:021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
           others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
           the way.

40:021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
           saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
           in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

40:021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
           saying, Who is this?

40:021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
           of Galilee.

40:021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
           that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
           of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

40:021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
           the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

40:021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
           healed them.

40:021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
           things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
           saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
           displeased,

40:021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
           saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
           babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

40:021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
           he lodged there.

40:021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

40:021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
           found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
           no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
           fig tree withered away.

40:021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
           soon is the fig tree withered away!

40:021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
           ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
           is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
           mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
           shall be done.

40:021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
           ye shall receive.

40:021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
           the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
           said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
           thee this authority?

40:021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
           thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
           what authority I do these things.

40:021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
           And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe
           him?

40:021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
           John as a prophet.

40:021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
           unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
           things.

40:021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
           the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

40:021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
           and went.

40:021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
           and said, I go, sir: and went not.

40:021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
           unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
           you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
           God before you.

40:021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
           believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
           him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
           ye might believe him.

40:021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
           planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
           winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
           husbandmen, and went into a far country:

40:021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
           to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

40:021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
           another, and stoned another.

40:021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
           did unto them likewise.

40:021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
           reverence my son.

40:021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
           themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
           us seize on his inheritance.

40:021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
           slew him.

40:021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
           do unto those husbandmen?

40:021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,
           and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
           shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

40:021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
           The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
           head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
           marvellous in our eyes?

40:021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
           from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
           thereof.

40:021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
           whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

40:021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
           parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

40:021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
           multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

40:022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
           said,

40:022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
           a marriage for his son,

40:022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
           the wedding: and they would not come.

40:022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
           are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
           fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
           marriage.

40:022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
           farm, another to his merchandise:

40:022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
           spitefully, and slew them.

40:022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
           forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
           their city.

40:022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
           which were bidden were not worthy.

40:022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
           find, bid to the marriage.

40:022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
           together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
           wedding was furnished with guests.

40:022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
           man which had not on a wedding garment:

40:022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
           having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

40:022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
           and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
           shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

40:022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
           entangle him in his talk.

40:022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
           saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
           way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
           regardest not the person of men.

40:022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
           tribute unto Caesar, or not?

40:022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
           me, ye hypocrites?

40:022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

40:022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
           superscription?

40:022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
           therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
           God the things that are God's.

40:022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
           and went their way.

40:022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
           is no resurrection, and asked him,

40:022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
           his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
           brother.

40:022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
           had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
           wife unto his brother:

40:022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

40:022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

40:022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
           seven? for they all had her.

40:022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
           scriptures, nor the power of God.

40:022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
           marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

40:022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
           that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

40:022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
           Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

40:022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
           doctrine.

40:022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
           to silence, they were gathered together.

40:022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
           tempting him, and saying,

40:022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

40:022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
           thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

40:022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

40:022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
           as thyself.

40:022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

40:022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

40:022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
           unto him, The son of David.

40:022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
           Lord, saying,

40:022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
           make thine enemies thy footstool?

40:022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

40:022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
           man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

40:023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

40:023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

40:023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
           and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
           not.

40:023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
           them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move
           them with one of their fingers.

40:023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
           broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
           garments,

40:023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
           the synagogues,

40:023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
           Rabbi.

40:023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
           Christ; and all ye are brethren.

40:023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
           Father, which is in heaven.

40:023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
           Christ.

40:023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

40:023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
           shall humble himself shall be exalted.

40:023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
           shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go
           in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go
           in.

40:023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
           widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore
           ye shall receive the greater damnation.

40:023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
           compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
           made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
           yourselves.

40:023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
           swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
           by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

40:023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
           temple that sanctifieth the gold?

40:023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
           whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

40:023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
           altar that sanctifieth the gift?

40:023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and
           by all things thereon.

40:023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
           him that dwelleth therein.

40:023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
           God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

40:023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
           tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
           weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
           these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
           undone.

40:023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

40:023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
           clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
           they are full of extortion and excess.

40:023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the
           cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

40:023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
           like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
           outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
           uncleanness.

40:023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
           within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

40:023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
           build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of
           the righteous,

40:023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would
           not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
           prophets.

40:023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
           children of them which killed the prophets.

40:023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

40:023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
           damnation of hell?

40:023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
           scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some
           of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
           them from city to city:

40:023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
           earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
           Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
           and the altar.

40:023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
           generation.

40:023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
           stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
           gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
           chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

40:023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

40:023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
           shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

40:024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
           disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
           temple.

40:024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily
           I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
           another, that shall not be thrown down.

40:024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
           unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
           be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
           of the world?

40:024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man
           deceive you.

40:024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
           deceive many.

40:024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
           not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
           end is not yet.

40:024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
           kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
           earthquakes, in divers places.

40:024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

40:024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
           you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

40:024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
           and shall hate one another.

40:024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

40:024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
           cold.

40:024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
           saved.

40:024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
           world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
           come.

40:024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
           spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,
           (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

40:024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

40:024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
           thing out of his house:

40:024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his
           clothes.

40:024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck in those days!

40:024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
           the sabbath day:

40:024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
           beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

40:024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no
           flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
           shortened.

40:024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
           there; believe it not.

40:024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
           shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
           possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

40:024:025 Behold, I have told you before.

40:024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
           desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers;
           believe it not.

40:024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
           unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

40:024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
           gathered together.

40:024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun
           be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
           stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
           shall be shaken:

40:024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
           and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
           shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
           power and great glory.

40:024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
           and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
           from one end of heaven to the other.

40:024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
           tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

40:024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that
           it is near, even at the doors.

40:024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
           all these things be fulfilled.

40:024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
           away.

40:024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
           heaven, but my Father only.

40:024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
           Son of man be.

40:024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
           and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
           that Noe entered into the ark,

40:024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
           shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

40:024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
           the other left.

40:024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be
           taken, and the other left.

40:024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
           come.

40:024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
           what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
           would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

40:024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
           not the Son of man cometh.

40:024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
           made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due
           season?

40:024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
           find so doing.

40:024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all
           his goods.

40:024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
           delayeth his coming;

40:024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and
           drink with the drunken;

40:024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
           not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

40:024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
           the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
           which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

40:025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

40:025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
           them:

40:025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

40:025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

40:025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
           cometh; go ye out to meet him.

40:025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

40:025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
           our lamps are gone out.

40:025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
           enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
           buy for yourselves.

40:025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
           were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was
           shut.

40:025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
           open to us.

40:025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
           not.

40:025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
           wherein the Son of man cometh.

40:025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
           country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
           his goods.

40:025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
           another one; to every man according to his several ability;
           and straightway took his journey.

40:025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
           with the same, and made them other five talents.

40:025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
           two.

40:025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
           hid his lord's money.

40:025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
           reckoneth with them.

40:025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
           other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
           five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents
           more.

40:025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
           servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
           make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of
           thy lord.

40:025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
           thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
           two other talents beside them.

40:025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
           thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
           ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

40:025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
           I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
           not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

40:025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
           lo, there thou hast that is thine.

40:025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
           servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
           gather where I have not strawed:

40:025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
           exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
           own with usury.

40:025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
           hath ten talents.

40:025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
           abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even
           that which he hath.

40:025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
           there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

40:025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
           angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
           glory:

40:025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
           separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his
           sheep from the goats:

40:025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
           the left.

40:025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
           blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
           from the foundation of the world:

40:025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
           ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

40:025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was
           in prison, and ye came unto me.

40:025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
           thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
           drink?

40:025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
           clothed thee?

40:025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

40:025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
           you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
           these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

40:025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
           me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
           and his angels:

40:025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
           and ye gave me no drink:

40:025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
           me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

40:025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
           thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
           or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

40:025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
           Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
           it not to me.

40:025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
           righteous into life eternal.

40:026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
           sayings, he said unto his disciples,

40:026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
           the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

40:026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
           and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
           priest, who was called Caiaphas,

40:026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
           him.

40:026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
           among the people.

40:026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
           leper,

40:026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
           precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at
           meat.

40:026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,
           To what purpose is this waste?

40:026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
           the poor.

40:026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
           the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

40:026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
           always.

40:026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
           it for my burial.

40:026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
           preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this
           woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

40:026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
           chief priests,

40:026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
           him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
           of silver.

40:026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

40:026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
           disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
           we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

40:026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
           The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
           at thy house with my disciples.

40:026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
           made ready the passover.

40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

40:026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
           of you shall betray me.

40:026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
           to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

40:026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
           the dish, the same shall betray me.

40:026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto
           that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good
           for that man if he had not been born.

40:026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is
           it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

40:026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
           brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
           this is my body.

40:026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
           saying, Drink ye all of it;

40:026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
           many for the remission of sins.

40:026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
           of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
           Father's kingdom.

40:026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
           of Olives.

40:026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
           of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the
           shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered
           abroad.

40:026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

40:026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
           offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

40:026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
           before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

40:026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
           not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

40:026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,
           and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray
           yonder.

40:026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
           began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

40:026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
           unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

40:026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
           prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
           pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

40:026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
           saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

40:026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
           indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

40:026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
           Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink
           it, thy will be done.

40:026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
           heavy.

40:026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
           time, saying the same words.

40:026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
           now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the
           Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

40:026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
           me.

40:026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
           and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
           the chief priests and elders of the people.

40:026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
           I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

40:026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
           kissed him.

40:026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
           came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

40:026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
           his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
           priest's, and smote off his ear.

40:026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
           place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
           sword.

40:026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
           shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

40:026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
           must be?

40:026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
           out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
           I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
           hold on me.

40:026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
           might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
           fled.

40:026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
           the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
           assembled.

40:026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
           and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

40:026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
           false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

40:026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
           found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

40:026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
           God, and to build it in three days.

40:026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
           nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

40:026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and
           said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
           us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

40:026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
           you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
           right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

40:026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
           blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now
           ye have heard his blasphemy.

40:026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

40:026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
           smote him with the palms of their hands,

40:026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
           thee?

40:026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
           him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

40:026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
           sayest.

40:026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
           and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with
           Jesus of Nazareth.

40:026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

40:026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said
           to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
           bewrayeth thee.

40:026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
           man. And immediately the cock crew.

40:026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
           Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
           out, and wept bitterly.

40:027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
           the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

40:027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
           him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

40:027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
           condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty
           pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

40:027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
           blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

40:027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
           departed, and went and hanged himself.

40:027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
           not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
           the price of blood.

40:027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
           field, to bury strangers in.

40:027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
           day.

40:027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
           prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
           the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
           Israel did value;

40:027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
           me.

40:027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
           him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
           unto him, Thou sayest.

40:027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
           answered nothing.

40:027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
           they witness against thee?

40:027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
           governor marvelled greatly.

40:027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
           people a prisoner, whom they would.

40:027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

40:027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
           them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
           which is called Christ?

40:027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

40:027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
           him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
           have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

40:027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
           they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

40:027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
           will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

40:027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
           is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

40:027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
           cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

40:027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
           a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
           the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
           person: see ye to it.

40:027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,
           and on our children.

40:027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
           Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

40:027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
           hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

40:027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

40:027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
           his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
           knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
           Jews!

40:027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
           the head.

40:027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
           from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
           crucify him.

40:027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
           name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

40:027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is
           to say, a place of a skull,

40:027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
           had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

40:027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
           that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
           They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
           they cast lots.

40:027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;

40:027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
           THE KING OF THE JEWS.

40:027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
           right hand, and another on the left.

40:027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

40:027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it
           in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
           down from the cross.

40:027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
           and elders, said,

40:027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
           Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
           believe him.

40:027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
           him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

40:027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
           in his teeth.

40:027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
           unto the ninth hour.

40:027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
           saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
           God, why hast thou forsaken me?

40:027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,
           This man calleth for Elias.

40:027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
           it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

40:027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
           save him.

40:027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
           the ghost.

40:027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
           top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
           rent;

40:027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
           which slept arose,

40:027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
           into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

40:027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
           Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,
           they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

40:027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
           Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

40:027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
           and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

40:027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
           named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

40:027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
           commanded the body to be delivered.

40:027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
           linen cloth,

40:027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
           rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
           sepulchre, and departed.

40:027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
           against the sepulchre.

40:027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
           the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

40:027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was
           yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

40:027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
           third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him
           away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so
           the last error shall be worse than the first.

40:027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
           as sure as ye can.

40:027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
           and setting a watch.

40:028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
           first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
           to see the sepulchre.

40:028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
           the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
           stone from the door, and sat upon it.

40:028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
           snow:

40:028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
           men.

40:028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
           for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

40:028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
           place where the Lord lay.

40:028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
           the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
           shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

40:028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
           great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

40:028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
           them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the
           feet, and worshipped him.

40:028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
           that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

40:028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
           the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things
           that were done.

40:028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
           counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

40:028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
           away while we slept.

40:028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
           and secure you.

40:028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
           saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

40:028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
           mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

40:028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

40:028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
           unto me in heaven and in earth.

40:028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
           name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

40:028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
           commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
           of the world. Amen.
Book 41        Mark

41:001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

41:001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
           before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

41:001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
           of the Lord, make his paths straight.

41:001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
           repentance for the remission of sins.

41:001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
           of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
           Jordan, confessing their sins.

41:001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
           skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

41:001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
           me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
           and unloose.

41:001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
           you with the Holy Ghost.

41:001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
           Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

41:001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
           opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

41:001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my
           beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

41:001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

41:001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
           Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
           unto him.

41:001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
           Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

41:001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
           at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

41:001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
           Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
           fishers.

41:001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
           you to become fishers of men.

41:001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

41:001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
           son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
           ship mending their nets.

41:001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
           Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after
           him.

41:001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
           day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

41:001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
           as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

41:001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
           and he cried out,

41:001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
           of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
           art, the Holy One of God.

41:001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
           him.

41:001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
           loud voice, he came out of him.

41:001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
           themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
           this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
           spirits, and they do obey him.

41:001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
           region round about Galilee.

41:001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
           entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
           John.

41:001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
           tell him of her.

41:001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
           immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

41:001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all
           that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

41:001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

41:001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
           out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
           they knew him.

41:001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
           went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
           prayed.

41:001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

41:001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek
           for thee.

41:001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I
           may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

41:001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
           and cast out devils.

41:001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
           down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
           make me clean.

41:001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
           touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

41:001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
           from him, and he was cleansed.

41:001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

41:001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
           thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
           cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
           unto them.

41:001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
           abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
           enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and
           they came to him from every quarter.

41:002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it
           was noised that he was in the house.

41:002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
           there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about
           the door: and he preached the word unto them.

41:002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
           was borne of four.

41:002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
           uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it
           up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

41:002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
           palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

41:002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and
           reasoning in their hearts,

41:002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
           but God only?

41:002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
           so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason
           ye these things in your hearts?

41:002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins
           be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
           walk?

41:002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
           to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

41:002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
           into thine house.

41:002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
           before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
           glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

41:002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
           resorted unto him, and he taught them.

41:002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting
           at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he
           arose and followed him.

41:002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
           many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
           his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

41:002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
           and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he
           eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

41:002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
           have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came
           not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

41:002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
           and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John
           and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

41:002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
           fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have
           the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

41:002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
           away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

41:002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
           else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
           and the rent is made worse.

41:002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
           wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
           bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
           bottles.

41:002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
           the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
           pluck the ears of corn.

41:002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
           sabbath day that which is not lawful?

41:002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
           he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
           him?

41:002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
           high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to
           eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
           him?

41:002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
           man for the sabbath:

41:002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

41:003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
           there which had a withered hand.

41:003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
           day; that they might accuse him.

41:003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
           forth.

41:003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
           days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held
           their peace.

41:003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
           grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the
           man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and
           his hand was restored whole as the other.

41:003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
           with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

41:003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
           a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

41:003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;
           and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they
           had heard what great things he did, came unto him.

41:003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
           on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

41:003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
           for to touch him, as many as had plagues.

41:003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,
           and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

41:003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him
           known.

41:003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
           would: and they came unto him.

41:003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
           he might send them forth to preach,

41:003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

41:003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;

41:003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;
           and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

41:003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
           Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and
           Simon the Canaanite,

41:003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
           into an house.

41:003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could
           not so much as eat bread.

41:003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
           him: for they said, He is beside himself.

41:003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
           Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
           devils.

41:003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,
           How can Satan cast out Satan?

41:003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
           cannot stand.

41:003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
           stand.

41:003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he
           cannot stand, but hath an end.

41:003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
           goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he
           will spoil his house.

41:003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the
           sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
           blaspheme:

41:003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
           forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

41:003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

41:003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
           without, sent unto him, calling him.

41:003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,
           Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

41:003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my
           brethren?

41:003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and
           said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

41:003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
           brother, and my sister, and mother.

41:004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
           gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
           ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the
           sea on the land.

41:004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them
           in his doctrine,

41:004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

41:004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,
           and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

41:004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;
           and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
           earth:

41:004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had
           no root, it withered away.

41:004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
           it, and it yielded no fruit.

41:004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang
           up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some
           sixty, and some an hundred.

41:004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
           hear.

41:004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
           twelve asked of him the parable.

41:004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
           mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,
           all these things are done in parables:

41:004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
           may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
           converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

41:004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
           will ye know all parables?

41:004:014 The sower soweth the word.

41:004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;
           but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh
           away the word that was sown in their hearts.

41:004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;
           who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
           with gladness;

41:004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
           afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the
           word's sake, immediately they are offended.

41:004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear
           the word,

41:004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
           and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
           it becometh unfruitful.

41:004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
           the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
           thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

41:004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
           bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

41:004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;
           neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
           abroad.

41:004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

41:004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what
           measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you
           that hear shall more be given.

41:004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
           from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

41:004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
           seed into the ground;

41:004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
           spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

41:004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the
           blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

41:004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
           the sickle, because the harvest is come.

41:004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
           with what comparison shall we compare it?

41:004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in
           the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

41:004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than
           all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls
           of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

41:004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as
           they were able to hear it.

41:004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they
           were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

41:004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
           Let us pass over unto the other side.

41:004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even
           as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
           little ships.

41:004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
           the ship, so that it was now full.

41:004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
           and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not
           that we perish?

41:004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
           Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
           calm.

41:004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that
           ye have no faith?

41:004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
           manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
           him?

41:005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the
           country of the Gadarenes.

41:005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met
           him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

41:005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind
           him, no, not with chains:

41:005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
           and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the
           fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.

41:005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
           tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

41:005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

41:005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
           thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
           God, that thou torment me not.

41:005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean
           spirit.

41:005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,
           My name is Legion: for we are many.

41:005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out
           of the country.

41:005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of
           swine feeding.

41:005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
           swine, that we may enter into them.

41:005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits
           went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran
           violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about
           two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

41:005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and
           in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was
           done.

41:005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with
           the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in
           his right mind: and they were afraid.

41:005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
           possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

41:005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

41:005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
           with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

41:005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
           thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done
           for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

41:005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
           things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

41:005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other
           side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the
           sea.

41:005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
           Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

41:005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at
           the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
           her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.

41:005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
           thronged him.

41:005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

41:005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
           all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew
           worse,

41:005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
           touched his garment.

41:005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be
           whole.

41:005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
           she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

41:005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
           out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
           touched my clothes?

41:005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude
           thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

41:005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

41:005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
           her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
           truth.

41:005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee
           whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

41:005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
           synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead:
           why troublest thou the Master any further?

41:005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto
           the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

41:005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
           and John the brother of James.

41:005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
           seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

41:005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
           ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

41:005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all
           out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and
           them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was
           lying.

41:005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
           cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee,
           arise.

41:005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of
           the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
           astonishment.

41:005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
           commanded that something should be given her to eat.

41:006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;
           and his disciples follow him.

41:006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
           synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From
           whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this
           which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are
           wrought by his hands?

41:006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
           James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his
           sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

41:006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
           but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own
           house.

41:006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his
           hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

41:006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
           about the villages, teaching.

41:006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them
           forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
           spirits;

41:006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their
           journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
           their purse:

41:006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

41:006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
           house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

41:006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye
           depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a
           testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be
           more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
           than for that city.

41:006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

41:006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
           were sick, and healed them.

41:006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
           and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead,
           and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

41:006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
           prophet, or as one of the prophets.

41:006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
           beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

41:006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
           bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
           wife: for he had married her.

41:006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
           have thy brother's wife.

41:006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
           killed him; but she could not:

41:006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
           holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
           things, and heard him gladly.

41:006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
           made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
           of Galilee;

41:006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
           danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
           said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I
           will give it thee.

41:006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
           give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

41:006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
           ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

41:006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
           asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
           the head of John the Baptist.

41:006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
           for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

41:006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
           his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
           prison,

41:006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:
           and the damsel gave it to her mother.

41:006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
           corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

41:006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
           told him all things, both what they had done, and what they
           had taught.

41:006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
           place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,
           and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

41:006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

41:006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
           afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
           together unto him.

41:006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved
           with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not
           having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

41:006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
           him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far
           passed:

41:006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about,
           and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have
           nothing to eat.

41:006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they
           say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
           bread, and give them to eat?

41:006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And
           when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

41:006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon
           the green grass.

41:006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

41:006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
           looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and
           gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two
           fishes divided he among them all.

41:006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.

41:006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of
           the fishes.

41:006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand
           men.

41:006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
           ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while
           he sent away the people.

41:006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
           pray.

41:006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea,
           and he alone on the land.

41:006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary
           unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh
           unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by
           them.

41:006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it
           had been a spirit, and cried out:

41:006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
           talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is
           I; be not afraid.

41:006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
           and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
           wondered.

41:006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
           heart was hardened.

41:006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
           Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

41:006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
           him,

41:006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
           carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he
           was.

41:006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
           country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him
           that they might touch if it were but the border of his
           garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

41:007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
           scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

41:007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
           defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found
           fault.

41:007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their
           hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

41:007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
           not. And many other things there be, which they have received
           to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and
           of tables.

41:007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
           disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
           bread with unwashen hands?

41:007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
           you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
           with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

41:007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
           commandments of men.

41:007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition
           of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such
           like things ye do.

41:007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
           God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

41:007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
           curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

41:007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
           Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
           profited by me; he shall be free.

41:007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
           mother;

41:007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,
           which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

41:007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
           them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

41:007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
           can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those
           are they that defile the man.

41:007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

41:007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
           disciples asked him concerning the parable.

41:007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
           Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
           entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;

41:007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
           and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

41:007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth
           the man.

41:007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
           thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

41:007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
           evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

41:007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

41:007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
           and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man
           know it: but he could not be hid.

41:007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
           spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

41:007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
           besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
           daughter.

41:007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
           it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it
           unto the dogs.

41:007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
           under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

41:007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
           gone out of thy daughter.

41:007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
           out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

41:007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
           came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts
           of Decapolis.

41:007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an
           impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
           upon him.

41:007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
           into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

41:007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
           Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

41:007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
           tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

41:007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
           he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
           it;

41:007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
           things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
           speak.

41:008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having
           nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith
           unto them,

41:008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
           with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

41:008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will
           faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

41:008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
           these men with bread here in the wilderness?

41:008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
           Seven.

41:008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he
           took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to
           his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
           the people.

41:008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded
           to set them also before them.

41:008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
           broken meat that was left seven baskets.

41:008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
           them away.

41:008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
           came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

41:008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
           seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

41:008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
           generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There
           shall no sign be given unto this generation.

41:008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
           the other side.

41:008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had
           they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

41:008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven
           of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

41:008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
           have no bread.

41:008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
           because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither
           understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

41:008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do
           ye not remember?

41:008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many
           baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,
           Twelve.

41:008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full
           of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

41:008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

41:008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto
           him, and besought him to touch him.

41:008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
           town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon
           him, he asked him if he saw ought.

41:008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

41:008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
           look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

41:008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
           town, nor tell it to any in the town.

41:008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of
           Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
           saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?

41:008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
           others, One of the prophets.

41:008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
           answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

41:008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

41:008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
           many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
           priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
           again.

41:008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began
           to rebuke him.

41:008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
           rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou
           savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that
           be of men.

41:008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
           also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him
           deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

41:008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
           shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
           shall save it.

41:008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
           world, and lose his own soul?

41:008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

41:008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in
           this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
           Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his
           Father with the holy angels.

41:009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
           some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,
           till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

41:009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
           John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by
           themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

41:009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as
           no fuller on earth can white them.

41:009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
           talking with Jesus.

41:009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for
           us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
           thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

41:009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

41:009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
           out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

41:009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no
           man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

41:009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
           they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the
           Son of man were risen from the dead.

41:009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one
           with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

41:009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias
           must first come?

41:009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
           restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man,
           that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

41:009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have
           done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

41:009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude
           about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

41:009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
           greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

41:009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

41:009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
           brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

41:009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
           and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to
           thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
           not.

41:009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
           shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
           unto me.

41:009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,
           straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground,
           and wallowed foaming.

41:009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
           unto him? And he said, Of a child.

41:009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the
           waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
           compassion on us, and help us.

41:009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
           possible to him that believeth.

41:009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
           with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

41:009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he
           rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf
           spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
           him.

41:009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:
           and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

41:009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he
           arose.

41:009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
           privately, Why could not we cast him out?

41:009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
           but by prayer and fasting.

41:009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
           would not that any man should know it.

41:009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
           man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill
           him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

41:009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
           him.

41:009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked
           them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the
           way?

41:009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed
           among themselves, who should be the greatest.

41:009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
           If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all,
           and servant of all.

41:009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and
           when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

41:009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
           receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not
           me, but him that sent me.

41:009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
           devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad
           him, because he followeth not us.

41:009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
           shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of
           me.

41:009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.

41:009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
           name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
           shall not lose his reward.

41:009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that
           believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were
           hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

41:009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
           to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into
           hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

41:009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
           to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into
           hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

41:009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for
           thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
           having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

41:009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

41:009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
           shall be salted with salt.

41:009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,
           wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
           peace one with another.

41:010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
           by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him
           again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.

41:010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for
           a man to put away his wife? tempting him.

41:010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command
           you?

41:010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
           and to put her away.

41:010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
           your heart he wrote you this precept.

41:010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
           female.

41:010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
           cleave to his wife;

41:010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
           twain, but one flesh.

41:010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
           asunder.

41:010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
           matter.

41:010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
           marry another, committeth adultery against her.

41:010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
           another, she committeth adultery.

41:010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
           them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

41:010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
           them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
           them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

41:010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
           of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

41:010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
           blessed them.

41:010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
           running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
           shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

41:010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
           none good but one, that is, God.

41:010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
           kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
           Honour thy father and mother.

41:010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I
           observed from my youth.

41:010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
           thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and
           give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
           come, take up the cross, and follow me.

41:010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
           had great possessions.

41:010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
           How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom
           of God!

41:010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
           answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
           for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of
           God!

41:010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
           than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

41:010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
           themselves, Who then can be saved?

41:010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible,
           but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

41:010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and
           have followed thee.

41:010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is
           no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
           father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
           sake, and the gospel's,

41:010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
           and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
           lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal
           life.

41:010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

41:010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
           before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they
           were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell
           them what things should happen unto him,

41:010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man
           shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the
           scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall
           deliver him to the Gentiles:

41:010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit
           upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise
           again.

41:010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
           saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us
           whatsoever we shall desire.

41:010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

41:010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
           right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

41:010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
           drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
           baptism that I am baptized with?

41:010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
           shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
           baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

41:010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to
           give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

41:010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
           with James and John.

41:010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
           that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
           exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
           authority upon them.

41:010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
           among you, shall be your minister:

41:010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
           all.

41:010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
           minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

41:010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
           his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus,
           the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

41:010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to
           cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

41:010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he
           cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on
           me.

41:010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
           they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
           rise; he calleth thee.

41:010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

41:010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
           should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
           might receive my sight.

41:010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
           whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
           Jesus in the way.

41:011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and
           Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his
           disciples,

41:011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against
           you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a
           colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

41:011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the
           Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him
           hither.

41:011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
           without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

41:011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do
           ye, loosing the colt?

41:011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they
           let them go.

41:011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
           him; and he sat upon him.

41:011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
           branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

41:011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
           saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
           Lord:

41:011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the
           name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

41:011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
           when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the
           eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

41:011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
           hungry:

41:011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if
           haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it,
           he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

41:011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
           hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

41:011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,
           and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,
           and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
           of them that sold doves;

41:011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel
           through the temple.

41:011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
           shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye
           have made it a den of thieves.

41:011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how
           they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the
           people was astonished at his doctrine.

41:011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

41:011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
           dried up from the roots.

41:011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master,
           behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

41:011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

41:011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
           mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
           shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
           things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
           whatsoever he saith.

41:011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when
           ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

41:011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
           any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you
           your trespasses.

41:011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
           heaven forgive your trespasses.

41:011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
           temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes,
           and the elders,

41:011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?
           and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

41:011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you
           one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what
           authority I do these things.

41:011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

41:011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

41:011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all
           men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

41:011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And
           Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what
           authority I do these things.

41:012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
           planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a
           place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to
           husbandmen, and went into a far country.

41:012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
           might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
           vineyard.

41:012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

41:012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
           cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away
           shamefully handled.

41:012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
           others; beating some, and killing some.

41:012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
           also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

41:012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
           come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

41:012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
           vineyard.

41:012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
           and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto
           others.

41:012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
           builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

41:012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

41:012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for
           they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
           they left him, and went their way.

41:012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
           Herodians, to catch him in his words.

41:012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
           that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest
           not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:
           Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

41:012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
           hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,
           that I may see it.

41:012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
           image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

41:012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the
           things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
           God's. And they marvelled at him.

41:012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
           resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

41:012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave
           his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
           should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

41:012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
           dying left no seed.

41:012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
           and the third likewise.

41:012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
           died also.

41:012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose
           wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

41:012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
           because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

41:012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,
           nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
           heaven.

41:012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
           the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,
           I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
           Jacob?

41:012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
           therefore do greatly err.

41:012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
           together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
           him, Which is the first commandment of all?

41:012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
           Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

41:012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
           with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
           strength: this is the first commandment.

41:012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
           neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
           than these.

41:012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
           truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

41:012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
           understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the
           strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than
           all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

41:012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
           him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man
           after that durst ask him any question.

41:012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
           How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

41:012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my
           Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
           footstool.

41:012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
           then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

41:012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
           which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
           marketplaces,

41:012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms
           at feasts:

41:012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
           prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.

41:012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
           people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich
           cast in much.

41:012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
           mites, which make a farthing.

41:012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
           Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
           than all they which have cast into the treasury:

41:012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
           want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

41:013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
           unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
           are here!

41:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
           buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,
           that shall not be thrown down.

41:013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the
           temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
           privately,

41:013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
           sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

41:013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man
           deceive you:

41:013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
           deceive many.

41:013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
           troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not
           be yet.

41:013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
           kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
           there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings
           of sorrows.

41:013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
           councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye
           shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a
           testimony against them.

41:013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

41:013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
           thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
           premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour,
           that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
           Ghost.

41:013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
           father the son; and children shall rise up against their
           parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

41:013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
           that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

41:013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
           by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
           that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee
           to the mountains:

41:013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
           house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his
           house:

41:013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to
           take up his garment.

41:013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck in those days!

41:013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

41:013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from
           the beginning of the creation which God created unto this
           time, neither shall be.

41:013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
           should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath
           chosen, he hath shortened the days.

41:013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
           lo, he is there; believe him not:

41:013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
           shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even
           the elect.

41:013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

41:013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
           darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

41:013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in
           heaven shall be shaken.

41:013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
           with great power and glory.

41:013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together
           his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the
           earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

41:013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
           tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

41:013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
           pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

41:013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,
           till all these things be done.

41:013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
           away.

41:013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
           angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

41:013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
           is.

41:013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
           his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
           man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

41:013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
           house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
           or in the morning:

41:013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

41:013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

41:014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of
           unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought
           how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.

41:014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
           of the people.

41:014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
           sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
           ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,
           and poured it on his head.

41:014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
           and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

41:014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
           and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against
           her.

41:014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
           wrought a good work on me.

41:014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
           ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

41:014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
           my body to the burying.

41:014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
           preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath
           done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

41:014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
           priests, to betray him unto them.

41:014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give
           him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

41:014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
           passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
           go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

41:014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
           them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man
           bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

41:014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
           house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I
           shall eat the passover with my disciples?

41:014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and
           prepared: there make ready for us.

41:014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
           found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
           passover.

41:014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

41:014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
           you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

41:014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
           one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?

41:014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,
           that dippeth with me in the dish.

41:014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe
           to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it
           for that man if he had never been born.

41:014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
           it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

41:014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it
           to them: and they all drank of it.

41:014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
           which is shed for many.

41:014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
           the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
           God.

41:014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
           of Olives.

41:014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
           me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
           and the sheep shall be scattered.

41:014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

41:014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
           will not I.

41:014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
           day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou
           shalt deny me thrice.

41:014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
           will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

41:014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
           saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

41:014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to
           be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

41:014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
           death: tarry ye here, and watch.

41:014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
           prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
           him.

41:014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
           take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
           what thou wilt.

41:014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
           Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

41:014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
           truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

41:014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

41:014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
           eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

41:014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
           now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;
           behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

41:014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

41:014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
           twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
           from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

41:014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
           Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
           him away safely.

41:014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
           saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

41:014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

41:014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
           servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

41:014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
           against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

41:014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
           not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

41:014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.

41:014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
           cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold
           on him:

41:014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

41:014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
           assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
           scribes.

41:014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
           high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself
           at the fire.

41:014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
           against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

41:014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
           agreed not together.

41:014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
           saying,

41:014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
           hands, and within three days I will build another made without
           hands.

41:014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.

41:014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
           saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
           against thee?

41:014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
           priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the
           Son of the Blessed?

41:014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
           on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
           heaven.

41:014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
           any further witnesses?

41:014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all
           condemned him to be guilty of death.

41:014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
           buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
           did strike him with the palms of their hands.

41:014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
           the maids of the high priest:

41:014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
           and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

41:014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
           thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock
           crew.

41:014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
           by, This is one of them.

41:014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
           said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art
           a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

41:014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this
           man of whom ye speak.

41:014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind
           the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
           thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he
           wept.

41:015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
           consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole
           council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered
           him to Pilate.

41:015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
           answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

41:015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
           answered nothing.

41:015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
           behold how many things they witness against thee.

41:015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

41:015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
           whomsoever they desired.

41:015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
           that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
           in the insurrection.

41:015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
           had ever done unto them.

41:015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
           you the King of the Jews?

41:015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

41:015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
           release Barabbas unto them.

41:015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
           then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
           Jews?

41:015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.

41:015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
           they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

41:015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
           Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged
           him, to be crucified.

41:015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called
           Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

41:015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
           thorns, and put it about his head,

41:015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

41:015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
           him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

41:015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
           him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
           crucify him.

41:015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
           out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
           his cross.

41:015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
           interpreted, The place of a skull.

41:015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
           received it not.

41:015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
           casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

41:015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

41:015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
           KING OF THE JEWS.

41:015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
           hand, and the other on his left.

41:015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
           numbered with the transgressors.

41:015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
           and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
           it in three days,

41:015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

41:015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
           with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

41:015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
           we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him
           reviled him.

41:015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
           whole land until the ninth hour.

41:015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
           Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
           God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

41:015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
           Behold, he calleth Elias.

41:015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on
           a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
           whether Elias will come to take him down.

41:015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

41:015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
           the bottom.

41:015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
           he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
           man was the Son of God.

41:015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
           Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses,
           and Salome;

41:015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
           ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with
           him unto Jerusalem.

41:015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the
           preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

41:015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also
           waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
           Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

41:015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
           him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
           dead.

41:015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
           Joseph.

41:015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
           in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out
           of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

41:015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where
           he was laid.

41:016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
           mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that
           they might come and anoint him.

41:016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
           came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

41:016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
           stone from the door of the sepulchre?

41:016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
           for it was very great.

41:016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
           on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
           were affrighted.

41:016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
           Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
           behold the place where they laid him.

41:016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
           before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said
           unto you.

41:016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
           they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to
           any man; for they were afraid.

41:016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
           appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast
           seven devils.

41:016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
           mourned and wept.

41:016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
           seen of her, believed not.

41:016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as
           they walked, and went into the country.

41:016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
           they them.

41:016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
           upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
           because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
           risen.

41:016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
           the gospel to every creature.

41:016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
           believeth not shall be damned.

41:016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
           shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

41:016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
           thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
           sick, and they shall recover.

41:016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received
           up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

41:016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
           working with them, and confirming the word with signs
           following. Amen.
Book 42        Luke

42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
           declaration of those things which are most surely believed
           among us,

42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
           were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
           all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
           most excellent Theophilus,

42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
           thou hast been instructed.

42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
           priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
           was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
           commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
           they both were now well stricken in years.

42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
           office before God in the order of his course,

42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to
           burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at
           the time of incense.

42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
           the right side of the altar of incense.

42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
           upon him.

42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
           prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
           and thou shalt call his name John.

42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
           at his birth.

42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
           drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
           with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
           their God.

42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
           to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
           disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
           prepared for the Lord.

42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
           for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
           stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
           and to shew thee these glad tidings.

42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
           the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
           believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
           season.

42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
           tarried so long in the temple.

42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
           perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
           beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
           ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
           herself five months, saying,

42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
           on me, to take away my reproach among men.

42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
           unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
           house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
           highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
           women.

42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast
           in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
           found favour with God.

42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
           a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
           and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
           David:

42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
           his kingdom there shall be no end.

42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
           know not a man?

42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
           come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
           thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
           thee shall be called the Son of God.

42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
           son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
           was called barren.

42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
           according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
           with haste, into a city of Juda;

42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
           Elisabeth.

42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
           of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
           with the Holy Ghost:

42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
           thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
           come to me?

42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
           mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
           performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
           behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
           is his name.

42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
           generation.

42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
           proud in the imagination of their hearts.

42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them
           of low degree.

42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
           hath sent empty away.

42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his
           mercy;

42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
           ever.

42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
           her own house.

42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
           and she brought forth a son.

42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
           shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
           circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
           name of his father.

42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
           called John.

42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
           called by this name.

42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
           called.

42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
           is John. And they marvelled all.

42:001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
           and he spake, and praised God.

42:001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
           these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
           country of Judaea.

42:001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
           saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of
           the Lord was with him.

42:001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
           prophesied, saying,

42:001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
           redeemed his people,

42:001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of
           his servant David;

42:001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
           since the world began:

42:001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
           all that hate us;

42:001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
           his holy covenant;

42:001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

42:001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
           the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

42:001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
           life.

42:001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
           for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
           ways;

42:001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
           remission of their sins,

42:001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
           from on high hath visited us,

42:001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
           of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

42:001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
           deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

42:002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
           decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
           taxed.

42:002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
           Syria.)

42:002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

42:002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
           Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
           Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

42:002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
           child.

42:002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
           accomplished that she should be delivered.

42:002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
           swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
           no room for them in the inn.

42:002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
           field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

42:002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
           of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

42:002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
           you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

42:002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
           which is Christ the Lord.

42:002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
           wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

42:002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
           heavenly host praising God, and saying,

42:002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
           toward men.

42:002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
           into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
           even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
           which the Lord hath made known unto us.

42:002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
           babe lying in a manger.

42:002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
           which was told them concerning this child.

42:002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
           told them by the shepherds.

42:002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
           heart.

42:002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
           all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told
           unto them.

42:002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
           the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
           the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

42:002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of
           Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
           present him to the Lord;

42:002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that
           openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

42:002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
           the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young
           pigeons.

42:002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
           Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
           consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

42:002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
           not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

42:002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
           parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the
           custom of the law,

42:002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

42:002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
           to thy word:

42:002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

42:002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

42:002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
           Israel.

42:002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
           spoken of him.

42:002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,
           Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
           many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

42:002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
           the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

42:002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
           of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived
           with an husband seven years from her virginity;

42:002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
           departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
           prayers night and day.

42:002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
           Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption
           in Jerusalem.

42:002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of
           the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city
           Nazareth.

42:002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
           wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

42:002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
           the passover.

42:002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
           after the custom of the feast.

42:002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
           child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his
           mother knew not of it.

42:002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
           day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
           acquaintance.

42:002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to
           Jerusalem, seeking him.

42:002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
           the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
           them, and asking them questions.

42:002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
           and answers.

42:002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
           unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
           father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

42:002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
           not that I must be about my Father's business?

42:002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

42:002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
           subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in
           her heart.

42:002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
           God and man.

42:003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
           Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being
           tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of
           Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
           tetrarch of Abilene,

42:003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
           came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

42:003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
           baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

42:003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
           prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
           Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

42:003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
           shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
           and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

42:003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

42:003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
           of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
           from the wrath to come?

42:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
           not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
           for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
           up children unto Abraham.

42:003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
           tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
           down, and cast into the fire.

42:003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

42:003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let
           him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
           him do likewise.

42:003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
           Master, what shall we do?

42:003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
           appointed you.

42:003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
           shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
           neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

42:003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
           their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

42:003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
           water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
           shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with
           the Holy Ghost and with fire:

42:003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
           floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the
           chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

42:003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
           people.

42:003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
           brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
           done,

42:003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

42:003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
           Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

42:003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
           upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
           my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

42:003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
           (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of
           Heli,

42:003:024 Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which
           was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was
           the son of Joseph,

42:003:025 Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos,
           which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which
           was the son of Nagge,

42:003:026 Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias,
           which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which
           was the son of Juda,

42:003:027 Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which
           was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel,
           which was the son of Neri,

42:003:028 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which
           was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was
           the son of Er,

42:003:029 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which
           was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was
           the son of Levi,

42:003:030 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which
           was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was
           the son of Eliakim,

42:003:031 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which
           was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which
           was the son of David,

42:003:032 Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which
           was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was
           the son of Naasson,

42:003:033 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram,
           which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which
           was the son of Juda,

42:003:034 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which
           was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was
           the son of Nachor,

42:003:035 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which
           was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was
           the son of Sala,

42:003:036 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad,
           which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was
           the son of Lamech,

42:003:037 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch,
           which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel,
           which was the son of Cainan,

42:003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which
           was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

42:004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
           and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

42:004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
           did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward
           hungered.

42:004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
           command this stone that it be made bread.

42:004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
           not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

42:004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
           unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

42:004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
           and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
           whomsoever I will I give it.

42:004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

42:004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
           Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
           and him only shalt thou serve.

42:004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
           the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
           thyself down from hence:

42:004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
           to keep thee:

42:004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
           thou dash thy foot against a stone.

42:004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
           tempt the Lord thy God.

42:004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
           from him for a season.

42:004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:
           and there went out a fame of him through all the region round
           about.

42:004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

42:004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
           his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
           and stood up for to read.

42:004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
           Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place
           where it was written,

42:004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
           to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
           brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
           recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
           are bruised,

42:004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

42:004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
           and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the
           synagogue were fastened on him.

42:004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
           fulfilled in your ears.

42:004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
           which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
           Joseph's son?

42:004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
           proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard
           done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

42:004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in
           his own country.

42:004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
           days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
           months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

42:004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
           city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

42:004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
           prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the
           Syrian.

42:004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
           were filled with wrath,

42:004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
           the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
           might cast him down headlong.

42:004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

42:004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them
           on the sabbath days.

42:004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
           with power.

42:004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
           unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

42:004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
           of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
           art; the Holy One of God.

42:004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
           him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
           out of him, and hurt him not.

42:004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
           What a word is this! for with authority and power he
           commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

42:004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
           round about.

42:004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
           house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
           and they besought him for her.

42:004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
           and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

42:004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
           divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
           on every one of them, and healed them.

42:004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
           art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them
           not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

42:004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
           and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
           that he should not depart from them.

42:004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
           other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

42:004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

42:005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
           hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

42:005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
           gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

42:005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
           prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.
           And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

42:005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
           into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

42:005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
           the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
           will let down the net.

42:005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
           of fishes: and their net brake.

42:005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
           ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
           filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

42:005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
           Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

42:005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the
           draught of the fishes which they had taken:

42:005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
           were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;
           from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

42:005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
           all, and followed him.

42:005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
           man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and
           besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
           clean.

42:005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
           thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

42:005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
           the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
           commanded, for a testimony unto them.

42:005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and
           great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
           him of their infirmities.

42:005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

42:005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
           there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which
           were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and
           Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

42:005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
           palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him
           before him.

42:005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him
           in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and
           let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst
           before Jesus.

42:005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
           are forgiven thee.

42:005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
           is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but
           God alone?

42:005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said
           unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

42:005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
           say, Rise up and walk?

42:005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth
           to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say
           unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine
           house.

42:005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that
           whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

42:005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
           filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

42:005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
           named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto
           him, Follow me.

42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

42:005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there
           was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down
           with them.

42:005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his
           disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and
           sinners?

42:005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need
           not a physician; but they that are sick.

42:005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

42:005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
           often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the
           Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

42:005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
           bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

42:005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
           away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

42:005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece
           of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new
           maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new
           agreeth not with the old.

42:005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new
           wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
           shall perish.

42:005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
           preserved.

42:005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new:
           for he saith, The old is better.

42:006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
           that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples
           plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their
           hands.

42:006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
           which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

42:006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
           this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they
           which were with him;

42:006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
           shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
           is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

42:006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the
           sabbath.

42:006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
           into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
           hand was withered.

42:006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
           heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation
           against him.

42:006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
           withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
           arose and stood forth.

42:006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
           lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
           life, or to destroy it?

42:006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
           Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
           restored whole as the other.

42:006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with
           another what they might do to Jesus.

42:006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
           mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

42:006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
           them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

42:006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
           James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

42:006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
           called Zelotes,

42:006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
           was the traitor.

42:006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
           company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out
           of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre
           and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their
           diseases;

42:006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
           healed.

42:006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
           virtue out of him, and healed them all.

42:006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
           be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

42:006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
           Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

42:006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
           separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and
           cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

42:006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
           reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their
           fathers unto the prophets.

42:006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
           consolation.

42:006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
           that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

42:006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
           their fathers to the false prophets.

42:006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to
           them which hate you,

42:006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which
           despitefully use you.

42:006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
           other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take
           thy coat also.

42:006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
           away thy goods ask them not again.

42:006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
           likewise.

42:006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
           sinners also love those that love them.

42:006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
           have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

42:006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
           have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
           again.

42:006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
           nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
           the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the
           unthankful and to the evil.

42:006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

42:006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
           shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

42:006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
           down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
           into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal
           it shall be measured to you again.

42:006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
           blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

42:006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
           perfect shall be as his master.

42:006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
           but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

42:006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull
           out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
           not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast
           out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
           see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

42:006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth
           a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

42:006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
           not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

42:006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
           forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
           treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for
           of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

42:006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
           say?

42:006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
           them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

42:006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and
           laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
           stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake
           it: for it was founded upon a rock.

42:006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without
           a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
           stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
           ruin of that house was great.

42:007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
           people, he entered into Capernaum.

42:007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
           sick, and ready to die.

42:007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
           Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

42:007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,
           saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

42:007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

42:007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
           the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
           Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou
           shouldest enter under my roof:

42:007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
           but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

42:007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
           soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to
           another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and
           he doeth it.

42:007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned
           him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
           unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

42:007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
           servant whole that had been sick.

42:007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
           called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
           people.

42:007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
           was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and
           she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

42:007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
           unto her, Weep not.

42:007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
           still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

42:007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
           delivered him to his mother.

42:007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
           That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
           visited his people.

42:007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
           throughout all the region round about.

42:007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

42:007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
           Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
           another?

42:007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
           sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or
           look we for another?

42:007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
           plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he
           gave sight.

42:007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
           John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind
           see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
           the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

42:007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

42:007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
           speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
           the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

42:007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
           raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and
           live delicately, are in kings' courts.

42:007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
           you, and much more than a prophet.

42:007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
           before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

42:007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
           is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
           least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

42:007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,
           justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

42:007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
           against themselves, being not baptized of him.

42:007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
           this generation? and to what are they like?

42:007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
           calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
           and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have
           not wept.

42:007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
           wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

42:007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold
           a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
           sinners!

42:007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

42:007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
           him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to
           meat.

42:007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
           knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
           an alabaster box of ointment,

42:007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
           his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
           head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
           ointment.

42:007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
           within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
           have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
           him: for she is a sinner.

42:007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
           say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

42:007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
           owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

42:007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
           both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

42:007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
           most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

42:007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
           this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no
           water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and
           wiped them with the hairs of her head.

42:007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
           in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

42:007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
           anointed my feet with ointment.

42:007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
           forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
           the same loveth little.

42:007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

42:007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
           themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

42:007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
           peace.

42:008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
           city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of
           the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

42:008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
           infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven
           devils,

42:008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and
           many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

42:008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to
           him out of every city, he spake by a parable:

42:008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
           by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
           air devoured it.

42:008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
           withered away, because it lacked moisture.

42:008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
           and choked it.

42:008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
           an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
           He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

42:008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
           be?

42:008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
           kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
           might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

42:008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

42:008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
           devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
           should believe and be saved.

42:008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
           word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
           believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

42:008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
           have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
           pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

42:008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
           good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth
           fruit with patience.

42:008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
           vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a
           candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

42:008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
           neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come
           abroad.

42:008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
           shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
           taken even that which he seemeth to have.

42:008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not
           come at him for the press.

42:008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
           brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

42:008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren
           are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

42:008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
           with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto
           the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

42:008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm
           of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were
           in jeopardy.

42:008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
           we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
           of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
           afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
           this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they
           obey him.

42:008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
           over against Galilee.

42:008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
           a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
           clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

42:008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
           with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
           thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

42:008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
           man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
           with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was
           driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

42:008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
           Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

42:008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
           into the deep.

42:008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
           mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to
           enter into them. And he suffered them.

42:008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
           swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
           lake, and were choked.

42:008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
           and told it in the city and in the country.

42:008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
           and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,
           sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
           and they were afraid.

42:008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
           possessed of the devils was healed.

42:008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
           about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
           with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned
           back again.

42:008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
           that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

42:008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath
           done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout
           the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

42:008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
           gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

42:008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
           of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
           besought him that he would come into his house:

42:008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
           she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

42:008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
           spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
           of any,

42:008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
           immediately her issue of blood stanched.

42:008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
           they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng
           thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

42:008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that
           virtue is gone out of me.

42:008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
           trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
           before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and
           how she was healed immediately.

42:008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
           hath made thee whole; go in peace.

42:008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
           synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
           trouble not the Master.

42:008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
           believe only, and she shall be made whole.

42:008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
           save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
           of the maiden.

42:008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is
           not dead, but sleepeth.

42:008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

42:008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
           saying, Maid, arise.

42:008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
           commanded to give her meat.

42:008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
           should tell no man what was done.

42:009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them
           power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

42:009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
           sick.

42:009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
           staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have
           two coats apiece.

42:009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
           depart.

42:009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that
           city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony
           against them.

42:009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
           gospel, and healing every where.

42:009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and
           he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John
           was risen from the dead;

42:009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one
           of the old prophets was risen again.

42:009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom
           I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

42:009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that
           they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into
           a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

42:009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he
           received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
           healed them that had need of healing.

42:009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
           said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
           the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get
           victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
           have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
           go and buy meat for all this people.

42:009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
           disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

42:009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

42:009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
           up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the
           disciples to set before the multitude.

42:009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up
           of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

42:009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
           were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
           that I am?

42:009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;
           and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

42:009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
           said, The Christ of God.

42:009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no
           man that thing;

42:009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
           rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
           slain, and be raised the third day.

42:009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
           him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

42:009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
           will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

42:009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
           lose himself, or be cast away?

42:009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
           shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
           glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

42:009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
           shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

42:009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
           he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
           to pray.

42:009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
           and his raiment was white and glistering.

42:009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
           and Elias:

42:009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
           should accomplish at Jerusalem.

42:009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
           and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
           that stood with him.

42:009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
           unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
           make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
           one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

42:009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
           them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

42:009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
           beloved Son: hear him.

42:009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
           kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those
           things which they had seen.

42:009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
           down from the hill, much people met him.

42:009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
           beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

42:009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and
           it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
           departeth from him.

42:009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
           not.

42:009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
           how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son
           hither.

42:009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
           him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
           child, and delivered him again to his father.

42:009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
           they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said
           unto his disciples,

42:009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
           shall be delivered into the hands of men.

42:009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
           that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
           saying.

42:009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should
           be greatest.

42:009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
           child, and set him by him,

42:009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
           name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
           him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
           shall be great.

42:009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
           devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
           not with us.

42:009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
           against us is for us.

42:009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
           received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

42:009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
           entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for
           him.

42:009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
           he would go to Jerusalem.

42:009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
           Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
           and consume them, even as Elias did?

42:009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
           manner of spirit ye are of.

42:009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
           save them. And they went to another village.

42:009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
           man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
           goest.

42:009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
           air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
           head.

42:009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
           me first to go and bury my father.

42:009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
           and preach the kingdom of God.

42:009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
           first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

42:009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
           plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

42:010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
           sent them two and two before his face into every city and
           place, whither he himself would come.

42:010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
           the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
           harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

42:010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

42:010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
           by the way.

42:010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
           this house.

42:010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
           it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

42:010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
           as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
           from house to house.

42:010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
           such things as are set before you:

42:010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
           kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

42:010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,
           go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

42:010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do
           wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that
           the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

42:010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
           day for Sodom, than for that city.

42:010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
           mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been
           done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
           sackcloth and ashes.

42:010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
           judgment, than for you.

42:010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
           thrust down to hell.

42:010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
           despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
           me.

42:010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
           the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

42:010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
           heaven.

42:010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
           scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
           shall by any means hurt you.

42:010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
           subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
           written in heaven.

42:010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
           O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
           things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
           babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

42:010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man
           knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,
           but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

42:010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
           Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

42:010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
           see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
           hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

42:010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
           saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

42:010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
           thou?

42:010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
           all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
           strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

42:010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
           thou shalt live.

42:010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
           is my neighbour?

42:010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
           Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
           him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
           half dead.

42:010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
           when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

42:010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
           looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

42:010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
           and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

42:010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
           wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
           and took care of him.

42:010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
           gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
           and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
           repay thee.

42:010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
           him that fell among the thieves?

42:010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
           him, Go, and do thou likewise.

42:010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
           certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
           into her house.

42:010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
           feet, and heard his word.

42:010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
           and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
           to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

42:010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
           careful and troubled about many things:

42:010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
           which shall not be taken away from her.

42:011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain
           place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,
           Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

42:011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art
           in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
           done, as in heaven, so in earth.

42:011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.

42:011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
           indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
           us from evil.

42:011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
           shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
           me three loaves;

42:011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
           nothing to set before him?

42:011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
           door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
           rise and give thee.

42:011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
           he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
           and give him as many as he needeth.

42:011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
           ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

42:011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
           findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

42:011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
           he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
           give him a serpent?

42:011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

42:011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
           children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
           Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

42:011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
           to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
           people wondered.

42:011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
           the chief of the devils.

42:011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

42:011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
           divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
           divided against a house falleth.

42:011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
           kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through
           Beelzebub.

42:011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
           cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

42:011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
           kingdom of God is come upon you.

42:011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
           peace:

42:011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
           him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
           divideth his spoils.

42:011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
           not with me scattereth.

42:011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
           through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith,
           I will return unto my house whence I came out.

42:011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

42:011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
           wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
           the last state of that man is worse than the first.

42:011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
           of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
           is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast
           sucked.

42:011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
           of God, and keep it.

42:011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
           say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there
           shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

42:011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
           Son of man be to this generation.

42:011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
           men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
           the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
           and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

42:011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
           preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

42:011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
           place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they
           which come in may see the light.

42:011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
           single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine
           eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

42:011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
           darkness.

42:011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
           dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
           shining of a candle doth give thee light.

42:011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
           him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

42:011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not
           first washed before dinner.

42:011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
           outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is
           full of ravening and wickedness.

42:011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
           which is within also?

42:011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
           all things are clean unto you.

42:011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
           manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
           these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
           undone.

42:011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
           the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

42:011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
           graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are
           not aware of them.

42:011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
           thus saying thou reproachest us also.

42:011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men
           with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not
           the burdens with one of your fingers.

42:011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
           your fathers killed them.

42:011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
           for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

42:011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them
           prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and
           persecute:

42:011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
           foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

42:011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which
           perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto
           you, It shall be required of this generation.

42:011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
           knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
           entering in ye hindered.

42:011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
           Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to
           speak of many things:

42:011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his
           mouth, that they might accuse him.

42:012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
           innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one
           upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
           Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

42:012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
           neither hid, that shall not be known.

42:012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
           in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
           closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

42:012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
           the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

42:012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
           after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
           unto you, Fear him.

42:012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
           them is forgotten before God?

42:012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
           not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

42:012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,
           him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of
           God:

42:012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
           angels of God.

42:012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
           shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
           the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

42:012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
           magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing
           ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

42:012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
           ought to say.

42:012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
           brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

42:012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider
           over you?

42:012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:
           for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
           which he possesseth.

42:012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
           certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

42:012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
           because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

42:012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
           build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
           goods.

42:012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
           for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

42:012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
           required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
           hast provided?

42:012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
           toward God.

42:012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
           no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the
           body, what ye shall put on.

42:012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

42:012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
           neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how
           much more are ye better than the fowls?

42:012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
           one cubit?

42:012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
           take ye thought for the rest?

42:012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
           not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
           not arrayed like one of these.

42:012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
           and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he
           clothe you, O ye of little faith?

42:012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
           neither be ye of doubtful mind.

42:012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
           and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

42:012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
           shall be added unto you.

42:012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
           to give you the kingdom.

42:012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags
           which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
           where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

42:012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

42:012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

42:012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when
           he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
           knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

42:012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
           find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
           himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
           forth and serve them.

42:012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
           watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

42:012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
           hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have
           suffered his house to be broken through.

42:012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
           hour when ye think not.

42:012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable
           unto us, or even to all?

42:012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
           whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give
           them their portion of meat in due season?

42:012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
           find so doing.

42:012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over
           all that he hath.

42:012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
           coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,
           and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

42:012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
           not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut
           him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
           unbelievers.

42:012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
           himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
           with many stripes.

42:012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
           shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is
           given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have
           committed much, of him they will ask the more.

42:012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
           already kindled?

42:012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
           straitened till it be accomplished!

42:012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
           Nay; but rather division:

42:012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
           three against two, and two against three.

42:012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
           against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
           daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her
           daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in
           law.

42:012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out
           of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so
           it is.

42:012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
           heat; and it cometh to pass.

42:012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
           earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

42:012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

42:012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as
           thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be
           delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the
           judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee
           into prison.

42:012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
           the very last mite.

42:013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the
           Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
           sacrifices.

42:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
           Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they
           suffered such things?

42:013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
           perish.

42:013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
           slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
           dwelt in Jerusalem?

42:013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
           perish.

42:013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
           planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,
           and found none.

42:013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
           three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find
           none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

42:013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year
           also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

42:013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou
           shalt cut it down.

42:013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

42:013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
           eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise
           lift up herself.

42:013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
           her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

42:013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
           straight, and glorified God.

42:013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
           because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said
           unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to
           work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
           sabbath day.

42:013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
           each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
           the stall, and lead him away to watering?

42:013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
           Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from
           this bond on the sabbath day?

42:013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
           ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious
           things that were done by him.

42:013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
           whereunto shall I resemble it?

42:013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast
           into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the
           fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

42:013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

42:013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
           measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

42:013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
           journeying toward Jerusalem.

42:013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
           he said unto them,

42:013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto
           you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

42:013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut
           to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at
           the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall
           answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

42:013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
           presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

42:013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
           depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

42:013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
           see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
           the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

42:013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
           the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the
           kingdom of God.

42:013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there
           are first which shall be last.

42:013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
           him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

42:013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I
           cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
           third day I shall be perfected.

42:013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
           following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
           Jerusalem.

42:013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
           stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have
           gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood
           under her wings, and ye would not!

42:013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say
           unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye
           shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

42:014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
           chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they
           watched him.

42:014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
           dropsy.

42:014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
           saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

42:014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,
           and let him go;

42:014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
           an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out
           on the sabbath day?

42:014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.

42:014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
           marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

42:014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in
           the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
           bidden of him;

42:014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
           man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

42:014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
           that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,
           Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
           presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

42:014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
           humbleth himself shall be exalted.

42:014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
           dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,
           neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also
           bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

42:014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
           lame, the blind:

42:014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
           for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

42:014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
           things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread
           in the kingdom of God.

42:014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
           bade many:

42:014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
           bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

42:014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
           said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
           needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

42:014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
           prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

42:014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I
           cannot come.

42:014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then
           the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
           out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring
           in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
           blind.

42:014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
           and yet there is room.

42:014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
           and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
           filled.

42:014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
           shall taste of my supper.

42:014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
           said unto them,

42:014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
           and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
           his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

42:014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,
           cannot be my disciple.

42:014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
           first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to
           finish it?

42:014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
           to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

42:014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

42:014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
           not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten
           thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty
           thousand?

42:014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
           ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

42:014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
           that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

42:014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
           shall it be seasoned?

42:014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but
           men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

42:015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
           hear him.

42:015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
           receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

42:015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

42:015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
           them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
           and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

42:015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
           rejoicing.

42:015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
           neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
           found my sheep which was lost.

42:015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
           sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
           persons, which need no repentance.

42:015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
           piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
           diligently till she find it?

42:015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
           neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found
           the piece which I had lost.

42:015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
           angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

42:015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:

42:015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
           the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
           them his living.

42:015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
           and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
           substance with riotous living.

42:015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
           land; and he began to be in want.

42:015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
           and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

42:015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
           the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

42:015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
           of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
           with hunger!

42:015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
           Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

42:015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of
           thy hired servants.

42:015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
           great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
           ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

42:015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
           heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
           thy son.

42:015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
           robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
           on his feet:

42:015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
           and be merry:

42:015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
           is found. And they began to be merry.

42:015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
           nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

42:015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
           meant.

42:015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
           killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
           sound.

42:015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
           father out, and intreated him.

42:015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
           serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
           commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
           make merry with my friends:

42:015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy
           living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

42:015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
           I have is thine.

42:015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
           thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
           found.

42:016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
           man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him
           that he had wasted his goods.

42:016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
           this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
           mayest be no longer steward.

42:016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
           lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg
           I am ashamed.

42:016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
           stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

42:016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and
           said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

42:016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
           Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

42:016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
           An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy
           bill, and write fourscore.

42:016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
           wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
           wiser than the children of light.

42:016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
           of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
           into everlasting habitations.

42:016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
           much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
           much.

42:016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
           mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

42:016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
           man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

42:016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
           one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
           despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

42:016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
           things: and they derided him.

42:016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
           before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is
           highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

42:016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
           kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

42:016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
           of the law to fail.

42:016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
           committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put
           away from her husband committeth adultery.

42:016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
           fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

42:016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
           at his gate, full of sores,

42:016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
           rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

42:016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
           the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
           was buried;

42:016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
           Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

42:016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
           send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
           and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

42:016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
           receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
           but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

42:016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
           fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
           neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

42:016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
           wouldest send him to my father's house:

42:016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
           they also come into this place of torment.

42:016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
           them hear them.

42:016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
           from the dead, they will repent.

42:016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
           neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

42:017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
           offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

42:017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
           neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one
           of these little ones.

42:017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
           rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

42:017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
           seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
           thou shalt forgive him.

42:017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

42:017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,
           ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
           the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey
           you.

42:017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
           will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,
           Go and sit down to meat?

42:017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
           sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
           drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

42:017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
           commanded him? I trow not.

42:017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
           are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
           done that which was our duty to do.

42:017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
           through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

42:017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
           men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

42:017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
           mercy on us.

42:017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
           unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
           they were cleansed.

42:017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
           and with a loud voice glorified God,

42:017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and
           he was a Samaritan.

42:017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
           where are the nine?

42:017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
           this stranger.

42:017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
           thee whole.

42:017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
           God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
           cometh not with observation:

42:017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
           the kingdom of God is within you.

42:017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
           shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
           shall not see it.

42:017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
           after them, nor follow them.

42:017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
           under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so
           shall also the Son of man be in his day.

42:017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
           generation.

42:017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
           days of the Son of man.

42:017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
           in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
           the flood came, and destroyed them all.

42:017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
           drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

42:017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
           brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

42:017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
           revealed.

42:017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
           stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
           he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

42:017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

42:017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
           whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

42:017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
           the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

42:017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
           and the other left.

42:017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
           other left.

42:017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
           unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
           gathered together.

42:018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
           always to pray, and not to faint;

42:018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
           neither regarded man:

42:018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
           saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

42:018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
           himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

42:018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
           by her continual coming she weary me.

42:018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

42:018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
           night unto him, though he bear long with them?

42:018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
           when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

42:018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
           themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

42:018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
           and the other a publican.

42:018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
           thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
           adulterers, or even as this publican.

42:018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

42:018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
           as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
           God be merciful to me a sinner.

42:018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
           than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
           abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

42:018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
           them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

42:018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little
           children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
           the kingdom of God.

42:018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
           of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

42:018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall
           I do to inherit eternal life?

42:018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is
           good, save one, that is, God.

42:018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
           kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy
           father and thy mother.

42:018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

42:018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
           lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
           distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
           heaven: and come, follow me.

42:018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
           rich.

42:018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
           hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
           God!

42:018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
           than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

42:018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

42:018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
           possible with God.

42:018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

42:018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
           that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or
           children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

42:018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and
           in the world to come life everlasting.

42:018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
           we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
           prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

42:018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
           mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

42:018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
           third day he shall rise again.

42:018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
           hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

42:018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
           certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

42:018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

42:018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
           me.

42:018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
           his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
           have mercy on me.

42:018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
           when he was come near, he asked him,

42:018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
           Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42:018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
           saved thee.

42:018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
           glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
           praise unto God.

42:019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

42:019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
           chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

42:019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
           press, because he was little of stature.

42:019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
           him: for he was to pass that way.

42:019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
           and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
           to day I must abide at thy house.

42:019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

42:019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
           gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

42:019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
           half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
           thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
           fourfold.

42:019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
           house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

42:019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
           lost.

42:019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
           because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought
           that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

42:019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country
           to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

42:019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
           and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

42:019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
           saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

42:019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
           received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
           called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
           know how much every man had gained by trading.

42:019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
           pounds.

42:019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
           hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
           ten cities.

42:019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
           pounds.

42:019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

42:019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
           which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

42:019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou
           takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou
           didst not sow.

42:019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
           thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
           man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did
           not sow:

42:019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at
           my coming I might have required mine own with usury?

42:019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
           and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

42:019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

42:019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
           given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
           taken away from him.

42:019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
           over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

42:019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
           Jerusalem.

42:019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
           Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two
           of his disciples,

42:019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which
           at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never
           man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

42:019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
           unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

42:019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he
           had said unto them.

42:019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
           unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

42:019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

42:019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
           upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

42:019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

42:019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
           mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
           rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
           works that they had seen;

42:019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
           Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

42:019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
           him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

42:019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
           should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

42:019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
           it,

42:019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
           day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
           hid from thine eyes.

42:019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
           cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
           thee in on every side,

42:019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
           within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
           another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

42:019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
           sold therein, and them that bought;

42:019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
           prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

42:019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
           the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

42:019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were
           very attentive to hear him.

42:020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught
           the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief
           priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

42:020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
           thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

42:020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one
           thing; and answer me:

42:020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

42:020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

42:020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for
           they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

42:020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

42:020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
           I do these things.

42:020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
           man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and
           went into a far country for a long time.

42:020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
           they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the
           husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

42:020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
           entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

42:020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
           him out.

42:020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
           send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when
           they see him.

42:020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among
           themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,
           that the inheritance may be ours.

42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
           therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

42:020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
           vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God
           forbid.

42:020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is
           written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
           become the head of the corner?

42:020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
           whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

42:020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
           lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
           perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

42:020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
           themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
           that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
           the governor.

42:020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
           and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of
           any, but teachest the way of God truly:

42:020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

42:020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
           tempt ye me?

42:020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
           answered and said, Caesar's.

42:020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
           which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

42:020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
           and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

42:020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
           there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

42:020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
           having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
           should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

42:020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
           wife, and died without children.

42:020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

42:020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
           they left no children, and died.

42:020:032 Last of all the woman died also.

42:020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
           seven had her to wife.

42:020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
           marry, and are given in marriage:

42:020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
           and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
           given in marriage:

42:020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
           angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
           resurrection.

42:020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
           when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
           Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

42:020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
           live unto him.

42:020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
           well said.

42:020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

42:020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's
           son?

42:020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
           unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

42:020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

42:020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

42:020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
           disciples,

42:020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
           love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
           synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

42:020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:
           the same shall receive greater damnation.

42:021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts
           into the treasury.

42:021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
           mites.

42:021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
           hath cast in more than they all:

42:021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
           offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
           living that she had.

42:021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
           goodly stones and gifts, he said,

42:021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in
           the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
           shall not be thrown down.

42:021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these
           things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall
           come to pass?

42:021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
           come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth
           near: go ye not therefore after them.

42:021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
           terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the
           end is not by and by.

42:021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
           kingdom against kingdom:

42:021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
           and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall
           there be from heaven.

42:021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
           persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into
           prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
           sake.

42:021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

42:021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before
           what ye shall answer:

42:021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
           adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

42:021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
           kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be
           put to death.

42:021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

42:021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

42:021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.

42:021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
           know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

42:021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
           let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
           them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

42:021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
           written may be fulfilled.

42:021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
           land, and wrath upon this people.

42:021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
           away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
           down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
           fulfilled.

42:021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
           the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with
           perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

42:021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
           those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
           heaven shall be shaken.

42:021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
           power and great glory.

42:021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
           lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

42:021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
           the trees;

42:021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
           that summer is now nigh at hand.

42:021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
           that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

42:021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
           till all be fulfilled.

42:021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
           away.

42:021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
           overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of
           this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

42:021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
           face of the whole earth.

42:021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
           worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and
           to stand before the Son of man.

42:021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at
           night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the
           mount of Olives.

42:021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
           temple, for to hear him.

42:022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
           the Passover.

42:022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
           him; for they feared the people.

42:022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
           number of the twelve.

42:022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
           captains, how he might betray him unto them.

42:022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

42:022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
           them in the absence of the multitude.

42:022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
           be killed.

42:022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
           passover, that we may eat.

42:022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

42:022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
           city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
           follow him into the house where he entereth in.

42:022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
           saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
           the passover with my disciples?

42:022:012 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
           ready.

42:022:013 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
           made ready the passover.

42:022:014 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve
           apostles with him.

42:022:015 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
           passover with you before I suffer:

42:022:016 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it
           be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

42:022:017 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
           divide it among yourselves:

42:022:018 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,
           until the kingdom of God shall come.

42:022:019 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
           unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
           this do in remembrance of me.

42:022:020 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
           new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

42:022:021 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
           the table.

42:022:022 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
           unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

42:022:023 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
           was that should do this thing.

42:022:024 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
           be accounted the greatest.

42:022:025 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
           lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them
           are called benefactors.

42:022:026 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
           him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
           serve.

42:022:027 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
           serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as
           he that serveth.

42:022:028 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

42:022:029 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
           unto me;

42:022:030 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
           on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

42:022:031 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
           have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

42:022:032 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when
           thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

42:022:033 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
           into prison, and to death.

42:022:034 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
           day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

42:022:035 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and
           scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

42:022:036 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
           take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword,
           let him sell his garment, and buy one.

42:022:037 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
           accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
           transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

42:022:038 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
           unto them, It is enough.

42:022:039 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
           Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

42:022:040 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
           enter not into temptation.

42:022:041 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and
           kneeled down, and prayed,

42:022:042 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
           nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

42:022:043 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,
           strengthening him.

42:022:044 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
           was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
           ground.

42:022:045 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his
           disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

42:022:046 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter
           into temptation.

42:022:047 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
           called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew
           near unto Jesus to kiss him.

42:022:048 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
           with a kiss?

42:022:049 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
           said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

42:022:050 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
           off his right ear.

42:022:051 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he
           touched his ear, and healed him.

42:022:052 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
           temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come
           out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

42:022:053 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no
           hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
           darkness.

42:022:054 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
           priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

42:022:055 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
           were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

42:022:056 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
           earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with
           him.

42:022:057 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

42:022:058 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
           also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

42:022:059 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
           affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him:
           for he is a Galilaean.

42:022:060 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
           immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

42:022:061 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter
           remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him,
           Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

42:022:062 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

42:022:063 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

42:022:064 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the
           face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote
           thee?

42:022:065 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

42:022:066 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
           chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into
           their council, saying,

42:022:067 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell
           you, ye will not believe:

42:022:068 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

42:022:069 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
           power of God.

42:022:070 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
           unto them, Ye say that I am.

42:022:071 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
           ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

42:023:001 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto
           Pilate.

42:023:002 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
           perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
           Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

42:023:003 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?
           And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

42:023:004 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I
           find no fault in this man.

42:023:005 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
           people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee
           to this place.

42:023:006 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
           Galilaean.

42:023:007 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's
           jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at
           Jerusalem at that time.

42:023:008 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
           desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard
           many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle
           done by him.

42:023:009 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
           nothing.

42:023:010 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
           him.

42:023:011 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
           him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
           Pilate.

42:023:012 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
           for before they were at enmity between themselves.

42:023:013 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
           the rulers and the people,

42:023:014 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
           perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him
           before you, have found no fault in this man touching those
           things whereof ye accuse him:

42:023:015 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
           worthy of death is done unto him.

42:023:016 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

42:023:017 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

42:023:018 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man,
           and release unto us Barabbas:

42:023:019 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,
           was cast into prison.)

42:023:020 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to
           them.

42:023:021 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

42:023:022 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
           done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore
           chastise him, and let him go.

42:023:023 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he
           might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief
           priests prevailed.

42:023:024 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

42:023:025 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
           cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered
           Jesus to their will.

42:023:026 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
           Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the
           cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

42:023:027 And there followed him a great company of people, and of
           women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

42:023:028 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
           not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

42:023:029 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
           Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the
           paps which never gave suck.

42:023:030 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
           to the hills, Cover us.

42:023:031 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be
           done in the dry?

42:023:032 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be
           put to death.

42:023:033 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
           there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the
           right hand, and the other on the left.

42:023:034 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
           they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

42:023:035 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
           derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if
           he be Christ, the chosen of God.

42:023:036 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
           him vinegar,

42:023:037 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

42:023:038 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
           Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

42:023:039 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
           saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

42:023:040 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou
           fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

42:023:041 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our
           deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

42:023:042 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest
           into thy kingdom.

42:023:043 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
           thou be with me in paradise.

42:023:044 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
           all the earth until the ninth hour.

42:023:045 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent
           in the midst.

42:023:046 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
           into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he
           gave up the ghost.

42:023:047 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
           saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

42:023:048 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
           the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

42:023:049 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
           Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

42:023:050 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and
           he was a good man, and a just:

42:023:051 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
           he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself
           waited for the kingdom of God.

42:023:052 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

42:023:053 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
           sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was
           laid.

42:023:054 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

42:023:055 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
           after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

42:023:056 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and
           rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

42:024:001 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
           they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they
           had prepared, and certain others with them.

42:024:002 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

42:024:003 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

42:024:004 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
           behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

42:024:005 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
           earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the
           dead?

42:024:006 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
           when he was yet in Galilee,

42:024:007 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of
           sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

42:024:008 And they remembered his words,

42:024:009 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
           unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

42:024:010 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of
           James, and other women that were with them, which told these
           things unto the apostles.

42:024:011 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
           believed them not.

42:024:012 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping
           down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and
           departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

42:024:013 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
           called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore
           furlongs.

42:024:014 And they talked together of all these things which had
           happened.

42:024:015 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
           reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

42:024:016 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

42:024:017 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
           that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

42:024:018 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
           unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
           known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

42:024:019 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
           Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in
           deed and word before God and all the people:

42:024:020 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
           condemned to death, and have crucified him.

42:024:021 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
           Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since
           these things were done.

42:024:022 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
           which were early at the sepulchre;

42:024:023 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they
           had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
           alive.

42:024:024 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
           and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw
           not.

42:024:025 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
           all that the prophets have spoken:

42:024:026 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
           into his glory?

42:024:027 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
           them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

42:024:028 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
           made as though he would have gone further.

42:024:029 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
           toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to
           tarry with them.

42:024:030 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
           bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

42:024:031 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
           out of their sight.

42:024:032 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within
           us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to
           us the scriptures?

42:024:033 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
           found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
           them,

42:024:034 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

42:024:035 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
           known of them in breaking of bread.

42:024:036 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
           them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

42:024:037 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
           had seen a spirit.

42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do
           thoughts arise in your hearts?

42:024:039 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
           and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
           have.

42:024:040 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
           feet.

42:024:041 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
           unto them, Have ye here any meat?

42:024:042 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an
           honeycomb.

42:024:043 And he took it, and did eat before them.

42:024:044 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
           you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be
           fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the
           prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

42:024:045 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
           the scriptures,

42:024:046 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
           Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

42:024:047 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
           in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

42:024:048 And ye are witnesses of these things.

42:024:049 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but
           tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with
           power from on high.

42:024:050 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
           hands, and blessed them.

42:024:051 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
           them, and carried up into heaven.

42:024:052 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
           joy:

42:024:053 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
           Amen.
Book 43        John

43:001:001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
           the Word was God.

43:001:002 The same was in the beginning with God.

43:001:003 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
           made that was made.

43:001:004 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

43:001:005 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
           comprehended it not.

43:001:006 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

43:001:007 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
           that all men through him might believe.

43:001:008 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
           Light.

43:001:009 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
           into the world.

43:001:010 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
           world knew him not.

43:001:011 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

43:001:012 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
           the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

43:001:013 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
           nor of the will of man, but of God.

43:001:014 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
           beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
           Father,) full of grace and truth.

43:001:015 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of
           whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me:
           for he was before me.

43:001:016 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

43:001:017 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
           Jesus Christ.

43:001:018 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which
           is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

43:001:019 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
           Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

43:001:020 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the
           Christ.

43:001:021 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I
           am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

43:001:022 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
           answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

43:001:023 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
           straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

43:001:024 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

43:001:025 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
           then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
           prophet?

43:001:026 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
           standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

43:001:027 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
           shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

43:001:028 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
           was baptizing.

43:001:029 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
           Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
           world.

43:001:030 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
           preferred before me: for he was before me.

43:001:031 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
           Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

43:001:032 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
           heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

43:001:033 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
           the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
           descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which
           baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

43:001:034 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

43:001:035 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

43:001:036 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb
           of God!

43:001:037 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
           Jesus.

43:001:038 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
           them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to
           say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

43:001:039 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he
           dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
           hour.

43:001:040 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
           Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

43:001:041 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
           have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
           Christ.

43:001:042 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
           said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
           Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

43:001:043 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and
           findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

43:001:044 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

43:001:045 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
           him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,
           Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

43:001:046 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out
           of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

43:001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
           Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

43:001:048 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus
           answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee,
           when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

43:001:049 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son
           of God; thou art the King of Israel.

43:001:050 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I
           saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
           greater things than these.

43:001:051 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
           Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
           ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

43:002:001 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
           the mother of Jesus was there:

43:002:002 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

43:002:003 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
           They have no wine.

43:002:004 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
           hour is not yet come.

43:002:005 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
           you, do it.

43:002:006 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
           manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
           firkins apiece.

43:002:007 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
           filled them up to the brim.

43:002:008 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
           governor of the feast. And they bare it.

43:002:009 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
           wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
           the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the
           bridegroom,

43:002:010 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
           good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
           worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

43:002:011 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
           manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

43:002:012 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and
           his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not
           many days.

43:002:013 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
           Jerusalem.

43:002:014 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
           doves, and the changers of money sitting:

43:002:015 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
           all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
           out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

43:002:016 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
           make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

43:002:017 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
           thine house hath eaten me up.

43:002:018 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest
           thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

43:002:019 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in
           three days I will raise it up.

43:002:020 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
           building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

43:002:021 But he spake of the temple of his body.

43:002:022 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
           remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed
           the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

43:002:023 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
           day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles
           which he did.

43:002:024 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew
           all men,

43:002:025 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew
           what was in man.

43:003:001 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
           the Jews:

43:003:002 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
           know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
           these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

43:003:003 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
           thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
           God.

43:003:004 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
           old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and
           be born?

43:003:005 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
           be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
           kingdom of God.

43:003:006 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
           born of the Spirit is spirit.

43:003:007 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

43:003:008 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
           thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
           goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

43:003:009 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

43:003:010 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
           and knowest not these things?

43:003:011 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
           testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

43:003:012 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
           shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

43:003:013 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
           from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

43:003:014 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
           must the Son of man be lifted up:

43:003:015 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
           eternal life.

43:003:016 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
           Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
           have everlasting life.

43:003:017 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
           but that the world through him might be saved.

43:003:018 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
           believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
           believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

43:003:019 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
           world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
           deeds were evil.

43:003:020 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
           to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

43:003:021 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
           may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

43:003:022 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land
           of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

43:003:023 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because
           there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

43:003:024 For John was not yet cast into prison.

43:003:025 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples
           and the Jews about purifying.

43:003:026 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
           with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,
           the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

43:003:027 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it
           be given him from heaven.

43:003:028 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the
           Christ, but that I am sent before him.

43:003:029 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of
           the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
           greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy
           therefore is fulfilled.

43:003:030 He must increase, but I must decrease.

43:003:031 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
           earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh
           from heaven is above all.

43:003:032 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no
           man receiveth his testimony.

43:003:033 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that
           God is true.

43:003:034 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
           giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

43:003:035 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
           hand.

43:003:036 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he
           that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath
           of God abideth on him.

43:004:001 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
           Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

43:004:002 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)

43:004:003 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

43:004:004 And he must needs go through Samaria.

43:004:005 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
           near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son
           Joseph.

43:004:006 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
           with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
           sixth hour.

43:004:007 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
           unto her, Give me to drink.

43:004:008 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

43:004:009 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
           being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
           for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

43:004:010 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
           God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
           wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
           living water.

43:004:011 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
           and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
           water?

43:004:012 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
           well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
           cattle?

43:004:013 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
           water shall thirst again:

43:004:014 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
           shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
           be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

43:004:015 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
           thirst not, neither come hither to draw.

43:004:016 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

43:004:017 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said
           unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

43:004:018 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is
           not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

43:004:019 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
           prophet.

43:004:020 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
           Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

43:004:021 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
           ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
           worship the Father.

43:004:022 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
           salvation is of the Jews.

43:004:023 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
           shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the
           Father seeketh such to worship him.

43:004:024 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
           spirit and in truth.

43:004:025 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
           called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

43:004:026 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

43:004:027 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
           with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
           talkest thou with her?

43:004:028 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
           city, and saith to the men,

43:004:029 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is
           not this the Christ?

43:004:030 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

43:004:031 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
           eat.

43:004:032 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

43:004:033 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
           brought him ought to eat?

43:004:034 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
           sent me, and to finish his work.

43:004:035 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh
           harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look
           on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

43:004:036 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
           life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may
           rejoice together.

43:004:037 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another
           reapeth.

43:004:038 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
           men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

43:004:039 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for
           the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that
           ever I did.

43:004:040 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
           that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

43:004:041 And many more believed because of his own word;

43:004:042 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
           saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is
           indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

43:004:043 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

43:004:044 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in
           his own country.

43:004:045 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received
           him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at
           the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

43:004:046 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the
           water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was
           sick at Capernaum.

43:004:047 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
           he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down,
           and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

43:004:048 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
           will not believe.

43:004:049 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

43:004:050 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
           believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went
           his way.

43:004:051 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
           him, saying, Thy son liveth.

43:004:052 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
           they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
           left him.

43:004:053 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
           Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and
           his whole house.

43:004:054 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was
           come out of Judaea into Galilee.

43:005:001 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
           Jerusalem.

43:005:002 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
           called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

43:005:003 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
           halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

43:005:004 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
           troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling
           of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
           he had.

43:005:005 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
           eight years.

43:005:006 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
           time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

43:005:007 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
           water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
           coming, another steppeth down before me.

43:005:008 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

43:005:009 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
           and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

43:005:010 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
           sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

43:005:011 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto
           me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

43:005:012 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
           Take up thy bed, and walk?

43:005:013 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
           conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

43:005:014 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
           Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
           come unto thee.

43:005:015 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
           had made him whole.

43:005:016 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
           him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

43:005:017 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
           work.

43:005:018 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
           only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his
           Father, making himself equal with God.

43:005:019 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
           unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth
           the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also
           doeth the Son likewise.

43:005:020 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
           himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these,
           that ye may marvel.

43:005:021 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
           even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

43:005:022 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
           unto the Son:

43:005:023 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
           Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father
           which hath sent him.

43:005:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
           believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
           shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
           unto life.

43:005:025 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
           is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and
           they that hear shall live.

43:005:026 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
           the Son to have life in himself;

43:005:027 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
           he is the Son of man.

43:005:028 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
           that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

43:005:029 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
           resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
           resurrection of damnation.

43:005:030 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
           judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the
           will of the Father which hath sent me.

43:005:031 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

43:005:032 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that
           the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

43:005:033 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

43:005:034 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
           that ye might be saved.

43:005:035 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for
           a season to rejoice in his light.

43:005:036 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works
           which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that
           I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

43:005:037 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness
           of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen
           his shape.

43:005:038 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath
           sent, him ye believe not.

43:005:039 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
           life: and they are they which testify of me.

43:005:040 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

43:005:041 I receive not honour from men.

43:005:042 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

43:005:043 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if
           another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

43:005:044 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and
           seek not the honour that cometh from God only?

43:005:045 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is
           one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

43:005:046 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he
           wrote of me.

43:005:047 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
           words?

43:006:001 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which
           is the sea of Tiberias.

43:006:002 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his
           miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

43:006:003 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
           disciples.

43:006:004 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

43:006:005 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company
           come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy
           bread, that these may eat?

43:006:006 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
           would do.

43:006:007 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
           sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

43:006:008 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
           unto him,

43:006:009 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
           small fishes: but what are they among so many?

43:006:010 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
           grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
           thousand.

43:006:011 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
           distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
           were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they
           would.

43:006:012 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up
           the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

43:006:013 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve
           baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which
           remained over and above unto them that had eaten.

43:006:014 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
           said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
           the world.

43:006:015 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take
           him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a
           mountain himself alone.

43:006:016 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the
           sea,

43:006:017 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward
           Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to
           them.

43:006:018 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

43:006:019 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty
           furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh
           unto the ship: and they were afraid.

43:006:020 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

43:006:021 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and
           immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.

43:006:022 The day following, when the people which stood on the other
           side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save
           that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus
           went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his
           disciples were gone away alone;

43:006:023 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the
           place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given
           thanks:)

43:006:024 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,
           neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to
           Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

43:006:025 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
           said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

43:006:026 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
           Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye
           did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

43:006:027 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
           which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man
           shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

43:006:028 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work
           the works of God?

43:006:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
           that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

43:006:030 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then,
           that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?

43:006:031 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He
           gave them bread from heaven to eat.

43:006:032 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
           Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father
           giveth you the true bread from heaven.

43:006:033 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
           giveth life unto the world.

43:006:034 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

43:006:035 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
           cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me
           shall never thirst.

43:006:036 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe
           not.

43:006:037 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
           cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

43:006:038 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
           will of him that sent me.

43:006:039 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
           which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
           it up again at the last day.

43:006:040 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
           seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting
           life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

43:006:041 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
           which came down from heaven.

43:006:042 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
           father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I
           came down from heaven?

43:006:043 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
           yourselves.

43:006:044 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
           draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

43:006:045 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
           God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of
           the Father, cometh unto me.

43:006:046 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of
           God, he hath seen the Father.

43:006:047 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
           everlasting life.

43:006:048 I am that bread of life.

43:006:049 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

43:006:050 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man
           may eat thereof, and not die.

43:006:051 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
           eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that
           I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
           world.

43:006:052 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can
           this man give us his flesh to eat?

43:006:053 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
           Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
           blood, ye have no life in you.

43:006:054 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal
           life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

43:006:055 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

43:006:056 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
           me, and I in him.

43:006:057 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
           so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

43:006:058 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
           fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this
           bread shall live for ever.

43:006:059 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in
           Capernaum.

43:006:060 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,
           said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?

43:006:061 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it,
           he said unto them, Doth this offend you?

43:006:062 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
           before?

43:006:063 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
           the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
           life.

43:006:064 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew
           from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who
           should betray him.

43:006:065 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
           unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

43:006:066 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
           more with him.

43:006:067 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?

43:006:068 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou
           hast the words of eternal life.

43:006:069 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son
           of the living God.

43:006:070 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of
           you is a devil?

43:006:071 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was
           that should betray him, being one of the twelve.

43:007:001 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not
           walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

43:007:002 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

43:007:003 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go
           into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that
           thou doest.

43:007:004 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he
           himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
           shew thyself to the world.

43:007:005 For neither did his brethren believe in him.

43:007:006 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your
           time is alway ready.

43:007:007 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify
           of it, that the works thereof are evil.

43:007:008 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for
           my time is not yet full come.

43:007:009 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in
           Galilee.

43:007:010 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto
           the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

43:007:011 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

43:007:012 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:
           for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he
           deceiveth the people.

43:007:013 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

43:007:014 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the
           temple, and taught.

43:007:015 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
           having never learned?

43:007:016 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
           his that sent me.

43:007:017 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
           whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

43:007:018 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
           seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
           unrighteousness is in him.

43:007:019 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth
           the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

43:007:020 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth
           about to kill thee?

43:007:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
           ye all marvel.

43:007:022 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is
           of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day
           circumcise a man.

43:007:023 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law
           of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I
           have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

43:007:024 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
           judgment.

43:007:025 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
           seek to kill?

43:007:026 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do
           the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

43:007:027 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh,
           no man knoweth whence he is.

43:007:028 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both
           know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself,
           but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

43:007:029 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

43:007:030 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
           because his hour was not yet come.

43:007:031 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
           cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man
           hath done?

43:007:032 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
           concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent
           officers to take him.

43:007:033 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,
           and then I go unto him that sent me.

43:007:034 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am,
           thither ye cannot come.

43:007:035 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that
           we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the
           Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

43:007:036 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me,
           and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?

43:007:037 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
           cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
           drink.

43:007:038 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of
           his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

43:007:039 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on
           him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given;
           because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)

43:007:040 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying,
           said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

43:007:041 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ
           come out of Galilee?

43:007:042 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of
           David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

43:007:043 So there was a division among the people because of him.

43:007:044 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands
           on him.

43:007:045 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
           they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

43:007:046 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.

43:007:047 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?

43:007:048 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

43:007:049 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

43:007:050 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night,
           being one of them,)

43:007:051 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what
           he doeth?

43:007:052 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
           Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

43:007:053 And every man went unto his own house.

43:008:001 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

43:008:002 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and
           all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught
           them.

43:008:003 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
           in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

43:008:004 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,
           in the very act.

43:008:005 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:
           but what sayest thou?

43:008:006 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse
           him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
           ground, as though he heard them not.

43:008:007 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
           said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him
           first cast a stone at her.

43:008:008 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

43:008:009 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own
           conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even
           unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman
           standing in the midst.

43:008:010 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,
           he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath
           no man condemned thee?

43:008:011 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I
           condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

43:008:012 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
           the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
           but shall have the light of life.

43:008:013 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
           thyself; thy record is not true.

43:008:014 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
           myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and
           whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I
           go.

43:008:015 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

43:008:016 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone,
           but I and the Father that sent me.

43:008:017 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men
           is true.

43:008:018 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent
           me beareth witness of me.

43:008:019 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered,
           Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye
           should have known my Father also.

43:008:020 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
           temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet
           come.

43:008:021 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall
           seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot
           come.

43:008:022 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
           Whither I go, ye cannot come.

43:008:023 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:
           ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

43:008:024 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for
           if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

43:008:025 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto
           them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

43:008:026 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
           sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I
           have heard of him.

43:008:027 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

43:008:028 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of
           man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of
           myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

43:008:029 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
           alone; for I do always those things that please him.

43:008:030 As he spake these words, many believed on him.

43:008:031 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
           continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;

43:008:032 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
           free.

43:008:033 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
           bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

43:008:034 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
           committeth sin is the servant of sin.

43:008:035 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
           abideth ever.

43:008:036 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
           indeed.

43:008:037 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,
           because my word hath no place in you.

43:008:038 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
           which ye have seen with your father.

43:008:039 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
           saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do
           the works of Abraham.

43:008:040 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the
           truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

43:008:041 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be
           not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

43:008:042 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love
           me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of
           myself, but he sent me.

43:008:043 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot
           hear my word.

43:008:044 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
           ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
           not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
           speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and
           the father of it.

43:008:045 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

43:008:046 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
           do ye not believe me?

43:008:047 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them
           not, because ye are not of God.

43:008:048 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well
           that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

43:008:049 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,
           and ye do dishonour me.

43:008:050 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
           judgeth.

43:008:051 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he
           shall never see death.

43:008:052 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a
           devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If
           a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

43:008:053 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and
           the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

43:008:054 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it
           is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is
           your God:

43:008:055 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
           say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I
           know him, and keep his saying.

43:008:056 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
           was glad.

43:008:057 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
           and hast thou seen Abraham?

43:008:058 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
           Abraham was, I am.

43:008:059 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid
           himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst
           of them, and so passed by.

43:009:001 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
           birth.

43:009:002 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
           man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

43:009:003 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
           but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

43:009:004 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
           the night cometh, when no man can work.

43:009:005 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

43:009:006 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
           of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
           the clay,

43:009:007 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is
           by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and
           washed, and came seeing.

43:009:008 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
           that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

43:009:009 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he
           said, I am he.

43:009:010 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

43:009:011 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay,
           and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of
           Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.

43:009:012 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

43:009:013 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

43:009:014 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and
           opened his eyes.

43:009:015 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
           his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and
           I washed, and do see.

43:009:016 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
           because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a
           man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a
           division among them.

43:009:017 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
           that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

43:009:018 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
           blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents
           of him that had received his sight.

43:009:019 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
           born blind? how then doth he now see?

43:009:020 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
           son, and that he was born blind:

43:009:021 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath
           opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
           speak for himself.

43:009:022 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews:
           for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess
           that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

43:009:023 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

43:009:024 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto
           him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

43:009:025 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know
           not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

43:009:026 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened
           he thine eyes?

43:009:027 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not
           hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his
           disciples?

43:009:028 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we
           are Moses' disciples.

43:009:029 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know
           not from whence he is.

43:009:030 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a
           marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet
           he hath opened mine eyes.

43:009:031 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
           worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

43:009:032 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
           eyes of one that was born blind.

43:009:033 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

43:009:034 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
           sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

43:009:035 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
           him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

43:009:036 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on
           him?

43:009:037 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he
           that talketh with thee.

43:009:038 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

43:009:039 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that
           they which see not might see; and that they which see might be
           made blind.

43:009:040 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these
           words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?

43:009:041 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:
           but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

43:010:001 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the
           door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the
           same is a thief and a robber.

43:010:002 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
           sheep.

43:010:003 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and
           he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

43:010:004 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
           and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

43:010:005 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him:
           for they know not the voice of strangers.

43:010:006 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not
           what things they were which he spake unto them.

43:010:007 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
           you, I am the door of the sheep.

43:010:008 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
           sheep did not hear them.

43:010:009 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
           and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

43:010:010 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
           destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they
           might have it more abundantly.

43:010:011 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
           the sheep.

43:010:012 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
           the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the
           sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
           the sheep.

43:010:013 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
           for the sheep.

43:010:014 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
           mine.

43:010:015 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
           down my life for the sheep.

43:010:016 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also
           I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
           one fold, and one shepherd.

43:010:017 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
           that I might take it again.

43:010:018 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
           power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
           commandment have I received of my Father.

43:010:019 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
           sayings.

43:010:020 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear
           ye him?

43:010:021 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.
           Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

43:010:022 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it
           was winter.

43:010:023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

43:010:024 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How
           long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell
           us plainly.

43:010:025 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the
           works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

43:010:026 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
           unto you.

43:010:027 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

43:010:028 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
           perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

43:010:029 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
           is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

43:010:030 I and my Father are one.

43:010:031 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

43:010:032 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
           Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

43:010:033 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
           not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,
           makest thyself God.

43:010:034 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
           are gods?

43:010:035 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and
           the scripture cannot be broken;

43:010:036 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into
           the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of
           God?

43:010:037 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

43:010:038 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
           ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in
           him.

43:010:039 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
           their hand,

43:010:040 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at
           first baptized; and there he abode.

43:010:041 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
           all things that John spake of this man were true.

43:010:042 And many believed on him there.

43:011:001 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the
           town of Mary and her sister Martha.

43:011:002 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
           wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

43:011:003 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
           whom thou lovest is sick.

43:011:004 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto
           death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
           glorified thereby.

43:011:005 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

43:011:006 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
           days still in the same place where he was.

43:011:007 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into
           Judaea again.

43:011:008 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
           stone thee; and goest thou thither again?

43:011:009 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
           man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the
           light of this world.

43:011:010 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
           no light in him.

43:011:011 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
           friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
           sleep.

43:011:012 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

43:011:013 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
           spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

43:011:014 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

43:011:015 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
           intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

43:011:016 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his
           fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

43:011:017 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
           four days already.

43:011:018 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
           off:

43:011:019 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
           concerning their brother.

43:011:020 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
           and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.

43:011:021 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
           brother had not died.

43:011:022 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
           God will give it thee.

43:011:023 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

43:011:024 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
           resurrection at the last day.

43:011:025 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
           that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

43:011:026 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
           Believest thou this?

43:011:027 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
           Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

43:011:028 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
           her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
           for thee.

43:011:029 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
           him.

43:011:030 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
           place where Martha met him.

43:011:031 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
           her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went
           out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep
           there.

43:011:032 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
           down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
           here, my brother had not died.

43:011:033 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
           weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was
           troubled.

43:011:034 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
           come and see.

43:011:035 Jesus wept.

43:011:036 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!

43:011:037 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
           eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
           have died?

43:011:038 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
           It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

43:011:039 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
           that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:
           for he hath been dead four days.

43:011:040 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
           wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

43:011:041 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead
           was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I
           thank thee that thou hast heard me.

43:011:042 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
           people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that
           thou hast sent me.

43:011:043 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
           Lazarus, come forth.

43:011:044 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
           graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.
           Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

43:011:045 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
           things which Jesus did, believed on him.

43:011:046 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told
           them what things Jesus had done.

43:011:047 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
           and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

43:011:048 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
           Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

43:011:049 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
           same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

43:011:050 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
           die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

43:011:051 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
           year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

43:011:052 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
           together in one the children of God that were scattered
           abroad.

43:011:053 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
           him to death.

43:011:054 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
           thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
           called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

43:011:055 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
           the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify
           themselves.

43:011:056 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as
           they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come
           to the feast?

43:011:057 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
           commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should
           shew it, that they might take him.

43:012:001 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
           Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the
           dead.

43:012:002 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus
           was one of them that sat at the table with him.

43:012:003 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
           and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her
           hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

43:012:004 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
           which should betray him,

43:012:005 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
           given to the poor?

43:012:006 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he
           was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

43:012:007 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
           hath she kept this.

43:012:008 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not
           always.

43:012:009 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
           they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
           Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

43:012:010 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
           also to death;

43:012:011 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and
           believed on Jesus.

43:012:012 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
           they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

43:012:013 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
           cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in
           the name of the Lord.

43:012:014 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it
           is written,

43:012:015 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting
           on an ass's colt.

43:012:016 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
           when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these
           things were written of him, and that they had done these
           things unto him.

43:012:017 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
           out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

43:012:018 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
           that he had done this miracle.

43:012:019 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
           ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

43:012:020 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to
           worship at the feast:

43:012:021 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
           Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

43:012:022 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
           tell Jesus.

43:012:023 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the
           Son of man should be glorified.

43:012:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
           into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
           bringeth forth much fruit.

43:012:025 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
           life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

43:012:026 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
           shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my
           Father honour.

43:012:027 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
           from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

43:012:028 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
           saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

43:012:029 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that
           it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

43:012:030 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,
           but for your sakes.

43:012:031 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
           this world be cast out.

43:012:032 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
           unto me.

43:012:033 This he said, signifying what death he should die.

43:012:034 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
           Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man
           must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

43:012:035 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light
           with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come
           upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither
           he goeth.

43:012:036 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
           children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and
           did hide himself from them.

43:012:037 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
           believed not on him:

43:012:038 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,
           which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to
           whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

43:012:039 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said
           again,

43:012:040 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that
           they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
           heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

43:012:041 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
           him.

43:012:042 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
           but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest
           they should be put out of the synagogue:

43:012:043 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

43:012:044 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not
           on me, but on him that sent me.

43:012:045 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

43:012:046 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on
           me should not abide in darkness.

43:012:047 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him
           not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

43:012:048 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one
           that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall
           judge him in the last day.

43:012:049 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
           he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should
           speak.

43:012:050 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting:
           whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me,
           so I speak.

43:013:001 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
           hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the
           Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
           them unto the end.

43:013:002 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the
           heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;

43:013:003 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
           hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;

43:013:004 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
           towel, and girded himself.

43:013:005 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash
           the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
           he was girded.

43:013:006 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
           dost thou wash my feet?

43:013:007 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not
           now; but thou shalt know hereafter.

43:013:008 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
           answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

43:013:009 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
           my hands and my head.

43:013:010 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
           his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not
           all.

43:013:011 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are
           not all clean.

43:013:012 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
           and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have
           done to you?

43:013:013 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

43:013:014 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye
           also ought to wash one another's feet.

43:013:015 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
           done to you.

43:013:016 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
           than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that
           sent him.

43:013:017 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

43:013:018 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that
           the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me
           hath lifted up his heel against me.

43:013:019 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass,
           ye may believe that I am he.

43:013:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
           send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that
           sent me.

43:013:021 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
           testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one
           of you shall betray me.

43:013:022 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
           spake.

43:013:023 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,
           whom Jesus loved.

43:013:024 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who
           it should be of whom he spake.

43:013:025 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is
           it?

43:013:026 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
           have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to
           Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

43:013:027 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
           him, That thou doest, do quickly.

43:013:028 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this
           unto him.

43:013:029 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that
           Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of
           against the feast; or, that he should give something to the
           poor.

43:013:030 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it
           was night.

43:013:031 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
           man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

43:013:032 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
           himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

43:013:033 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall
           seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot
           come; so now I say to you.

43:013:034 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
           as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

43:013:035 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
           have love one to another.

43:013:036 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
           answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but
           thou shalt follow me afterwards.

43:013:037 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I
           will lay down my life for thy sake.

43:013:038 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
           Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till
           thou hast denied me thrice.

43:014:001 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
           also in me.

43:014:002 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
           would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

43:014:003 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
           and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
           also.

43:014:004 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

43:014:005 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
           and how can we know the way?

43:014:006 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
           no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

43:014:007 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and
           from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

43:014:008 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it
           sufficeth us.

43:014:009 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and
           yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
           seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?

43:014:010 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
           me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but
           the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

43:014:011 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or
           else believe me for the very works' sake.

43:014:012 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
           works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these
           shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

43:014:013 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that
           the Father may be glorified in the Son.

43:014:014 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

43:014:015 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

43:014:016 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
           Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;

43:014:017 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,
           because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know
           him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

43:014:018 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

43:014:019 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
           me: because I live, ye shall live also.

43:014:020 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in
           me, and I in you.

43:014:021 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
           loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,
           and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

43:014:022 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
           wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?

43:014:023 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
           keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come
           unto him, and make our abode with him.

43:014:024 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word
           which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

43:014:025 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with
           you.

43:014:026 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
           will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
           all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
           you.

43:014:027 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
           world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
           neither let it be afraid.

43:014:028 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
           unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I
           go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

43:014:029 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it
           is come to pass, ye might believe.

43:014:030 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of
           this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

43:014:031 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
           Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go
           hence.

43:015:001 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

43:015:002 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
           every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may
           bring forth more fruit.

43:015:003 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
           you.

43:015:004 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
           itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye
           abide in me.

43:015:005 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and
           I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me
           ye can do nothing.

43:015:006 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
           withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,
           and they are burned.

43:015:007 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
           what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

43:015:008 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
           shall ye be my disciples.

43:015:009 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye
           in my love.

43:015:010 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as
           I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

43:015:011 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain
           in you, and that your joy might be full.

43:015:012 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
           loved you.

43:015:013 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
           life for his friends.

43:015:014 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

43:015:015 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
           not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for
           all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known
           unto you.

43:015:016 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
           you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your
           fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
           Father in my name, he may give it you.

43:015:017 These things I command you, that ye love one another.

43:015:018 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it
           hated you.

43:015:019 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
           because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
           the world, therefore the world hateth you.

43:015:020 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
           greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will
           also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will
           keep yours also.

43:015:021 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,
           because they know not him that sent me.

43:015:022 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
           but now they have no cloak for their sin.

43:015:023 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

43:015:024 If I had not done among them the works which none other man
           did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and
           hated both me and my Father.

43:015:025 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
           is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

43:015:026 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
           the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from
           the Father, he shall testify of me:

43:015:027 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me
           from the beginning.

43:016:001 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
           offended.

43:016:002 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time
           cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth
           God service.

43:016:003 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
           known the Father, nor me.

43:016:004 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall
           come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these
           things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was
           with you.

43:016:005 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you
           asketh me, Whither goest thou?

43:016:006 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
           filled your heart.

43:016:007 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you
           that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
           come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

43:016:008 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
           righteousness, and of judgment:

43:016:009 Of sin, because they believe not on me;

43:016:010 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no
           more;

43:016:011 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

43:016:012 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
           them now.

43:016:013 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
           you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but
           whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will
           shew you things to come.

43:016:014 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
           shew it unto you.

43:016:015 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,
           that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

43:016:016 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
           while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

43:016:017 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
           that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see
           me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and,
           Because I go to the Father?

43:016:018 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little
           while? we cannot tell what he saith.

43:016:019 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said
           unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A
           little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
           while, and ye shall see me?

43:016:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament,
           but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but
           your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

43:016:021 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour
           is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she
           remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born
           into the world.

43:016:022 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again,
           and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from
           you.

43:016:023 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
           unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he
           will give it you.

43:016:024 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
           receive, that your joy may be full.

43:016:025 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
           cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I
           shall shew you plainly of the Father.

43:016:026 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
           that I will pray the Father for you:

43:016:027 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me,
           and have believed that I came out from God.

43:016:028 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:
           again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

43:016:029 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly,
           and speakest no proverb.

43:016:030 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
           that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou
           camest forth from God.

43:016:031 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

43:016:032 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
           scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and
           yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

43:016:033 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
           peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good
           cheer; I have overcome the world.

43:017:001 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
           said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son
           also may glorify thee:

43:017:002 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should
           give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

43:017:003 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
           true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

43:017:004 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
           which thou gavest me to do.

43:017:005 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
           the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

43:017:006 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
           out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me;
           and they have kept thy word.

43:017:007 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
           me are of thee.

43:017:008 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
           they have received them, and have known surely that I came out
           from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

43:017:009 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
           thou hast given me; for they are thine.

43:017:010 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
           in them.

43:017:011 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
           and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name
           those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we
           are.

43:017:012 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
           those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is
           lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be
           fulfilled.

43:017:013 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
           that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

43:017:014 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
           because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the
           world.

43:017:015 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
           that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

43:017:016 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

43:017:017 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

43:017:018 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
           them into the world.

43:017:019 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
           sanctified through the truth.

43:017:020 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
           believe on me through their word;

43:017:021 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
           thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
           believe that thou hast sent me.

43:017:022 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that
           they may be one, even as we are one:

43:017:023 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
           one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and
           hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

43:017:024 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
           with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
           hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of
           the world.

43:017:025 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
           known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

43:017:026 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
           that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and
           I in them.

43:018:001 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
           disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the
           which he entered, and his disciples.

43:018:002 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
           ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

43:018:003 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from
           the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns
           and torches and weapons.

43:018:004 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
           went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

43:018:005 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I
           am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

43:018:006 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
           backward, and fell to the ground.

43:018:007 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus
           of Nazareth.

43:018:008 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
           seek me, let these go their way:

43:018:009 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them
           which thou gavest me have I lost none.

43:018:010 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
           priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's
           name was Malchus.

43:018:011 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
           the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

43:018:012 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took
           Jesus, and bound him,

43:018:013 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to
           Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

43:018:014 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it
           was expedient that one man should die for the people.

43:018:015 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
           that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with
           Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

43:018:016 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
           disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto
           her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

43:018:017 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
           thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

43:018:018 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
           of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and
           Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

43:018:019 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
           doctrine.

43:018:020 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
           in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always
           resort; and in secret have I said nothing.

43:018:021 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
           unto them: behold, they know what I said.

43:018:022 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood
           by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest
           thou the high priest so?

43:018:023 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
           evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?

43:018:024 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

43:018:025 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
           unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied
           it, and said, I am not.

43:018:026 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman
           whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the
           garden with him?

43:018:027 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.

43:018:028 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:
           and it was early; and they themselves went not into the
           judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they
           might eat the passover.

43:018:029 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation
           bring ye against this man?

43:018:030 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,
           we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

43:018:031 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him
           according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is
           not lawful for us to put any man to death:

43:018:032 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
           signifying what death he should die.

43:018:033 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
           Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?

43:018:034 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did
           others tell it thee of me?

43:018:035 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
           priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?

43:018:036 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
           were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
           should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not
           from hence.

43:018:037 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
           answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I
           born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should
           bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth
           heareth my voice.

43:018:038 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
           this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
           find in him no fault at all.

43:018:039 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at
           the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the
           King of the Jews?

43:018:040 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.
           Now Barabbas was a robber.

43:019:001 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.

43:019:002 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
           head, and they put on him a purple robe,

43:019:003 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with
           their hands.

43:019:004 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them,
           Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find
           no fault in him.

43:019:005 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
           purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!

43:019:006 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they
           cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto
           them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in
           him.

43:019:007 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought
           to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

43:019:008 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more
           afraid;

43:019:009 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
           Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

43:019:010 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
           thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to
           release thee?

43:019:011 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me,
           except it were given thee from above: therefore he that
           delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

43:019:012 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the
           Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not
           Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
           against Caesar.

43:019:013 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus
           forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is
           called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

43:019:014 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the
           sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!

43:019:015 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
           Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief
           priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

43:019:016 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
           they took Jesus, and led him away.

43:019:017 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
           place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:

43:019:018 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either
           side one, and Jesus in the midst.

43:019:019 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
           writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

43:019:020 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where
           Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written
           in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.

43:019:021 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
           The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

43:019:022 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

43:019:023 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
           garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and
           also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the
           top throughout.

43:019:024 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
           cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
           be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
           and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore
           the soldiers did.

43:019:025 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
           mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
           Magdalene.

43:019:026 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
           by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy
           son!

43:019:027 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
           that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

43:019:028 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now
           accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I
           thirst.

43:019:029 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
           spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his
           mouth.

43:019:030 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
           finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

43:019:031 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
           bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day,
           (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that
           their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

43:019:032 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and
           of the other which was crucified with him.

43:019:033 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
           they brake not his legs:

43:019:034 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
           forthwith came there out blood and water.

43:019:035 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
           knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

43:019:036 For these things were done, that the scripture should be
           fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

43:019:037 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
           they pierced.

43:019:038 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of
           Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that
           he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him
           leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

43:019:039 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to
           Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
           about an hundred pound weight.

43:019:040 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen
           clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

43:019:041 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden;
           and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet
           laid.

43:019:042 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews'
           preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

43:020:001 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
           was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken
           away from the sepulchre.

43:020:002 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
           disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have
           taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not
           where they have laid him.

43:020:003 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came
           to the sepulchre.

43:020:004 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
           Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

43:020:005 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
           lying; yet went he not in.

43:020:006 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
           sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,

43:020:007 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the
           linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.

43:020:008 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
           sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

43:020:009 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise
           again from the dead.

43:020:010 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

43:020:011 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
           wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,

43:020:012 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head,
           and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

43:020:013 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
           them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not
           where they have laid him.

43:020:014 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
           Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

43:020:015 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
           thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him,
           Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast
           laid him, and I will take him away.

43:020:016 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
           him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

43:020:017 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
           to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
           ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and
           your God.

43:020:018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
           the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

43:020:019 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
           when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
           for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and
           saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

43:020:020 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
           side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.

43:020:021 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
           hath sent me, even so send I you.

43:020:022 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
           them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:

43:020:023 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
           whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

43:020:024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
           them when Jesus came.

43:020:025 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
           LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands
           the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of
           the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
           believe.

43:020:026 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and
           Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and
           stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

43:020:027 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold
           my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my
           side: and be not faithless, but believing.

43:020:028 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.

43:020:029 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
           hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet
           have believed.

43:020:030 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
           disciples, which are not written in this book:

43:020:031 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
           Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
           through his name.

43:021:001 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples
           at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

43:021:002 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,
           and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and
           two other of his disciples.

43:021:003 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto
           him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a
           ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.

43:021:004 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
           but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

43:021:005 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
           answered him, No.

43:021:006 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
           ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they
           were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

43:021:007 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It
           is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
           he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and
           did cast himself into the sea.

43:021:008 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were
           not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
           dragging the net with fishes.

43:021:009 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
           coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

43:021:010 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
           caught.

43:021:011 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
           fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were
           so many, yet was not the net broken.

43:021:012 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the
           disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the
           Lord.

43:021:013 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
           likewise.

43:021:014 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
           disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

43:021:015 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
           of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
           Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
           Feed my lambs.

43:021:016 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
           lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
           that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

43:021:017 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
           thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
           time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
           all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
           him, Feed my sheep.

43:021:018 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
           girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
           thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
           another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest
           not.

43:021:019 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
           And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

43:021:020 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
           following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and
           said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

43:021:021 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man
           do?

43:021:022 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
           what is that to thee? follow thou me.

43:021:023 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
           disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
           not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
           that to thee?

43:021:024 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
           wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

43:021:025 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
           which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that
           even the world itself could not contain the books that should
           be written. Amen.
Book 44        Acts

44:001:001 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
           Jesus began both to do and teach,

44:001:002 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
           the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom
           he had chosen:

44:001:003 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
           infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking
           of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:

44:001:004 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
           they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
           promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.

44:001:005 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
           with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

44:001:006 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
           saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
           to Israel?

44:001:007 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
           the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

44:001:008 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
           upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
           and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
           of the earth.

44:001:009 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
           taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

44:001:010 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
           behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

44:001:011 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
           into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
           heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
           into heaven.

44:001:012 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called
           Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

44:001:013 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
           where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,
           Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of
           Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.

44:001:014 These all continued with one accord in prayer and
           supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
           and with his brethren.

44:001:015 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the
           disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about
           an hundred and twenty,)

44:001:016 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
           fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
           before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took
           Jesus.

44:001:017 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
           ministry.

44:001:018 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
           and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all
           his bowels gushed out.

44:001:019 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
           as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
           is to say, The field of blood.

44:001:020 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
           desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let
           another take.

44:001:021 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the
           time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

44:001:022 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he
           was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
           with us of his resurrection.

44:001:023 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
           surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

44:001:024 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the
           hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

44:001:025 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
           which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
           place.

44:001:026 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon
           Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

44:002:001 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
           with one accord in one place.

44:002:002 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
           mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
           sitting.

44:002:003 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
           and it sat upon each of them.

44:002:004 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
           speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

44:002:005 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
           every nation under heaven.

44:002:006 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
           and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak
           in his own language.

44:002:007 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
           Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

44:002:008 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
           born?

44:002:009 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
           Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and
           Asia,

44:002:010 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
           about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

44:002:011 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the
           wonderful works of God.

44:002:012 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
           another, What meaneth this?

44:002:013 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

44:002:014 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
           and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at
           Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:

44:002:015 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the
           third hour of the day.

44:002:016 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;

44:002:017 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
           pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
           daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see
           visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

44:002:018 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
           those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

44:002:019 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the
           earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:

44:002:020 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
           blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:

44:002:021 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
           name of the Lord shall be saved.

44:002:022 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
           approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
           which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves
           also know:

44:002:023 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
           foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
           crucified and slain:

44:002:024 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
           because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.

44:002:025 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
           before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not
           be moved:

44:002:026 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
           moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:

44:002:027 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

44:002:028 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
           me full of joy with thy countenance.

44:002:029 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
           patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
           sepulchre is with us unto this day.

44:002:030 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
           an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
           the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

44:002:031 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
           that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
           corruption.

44:002:032 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

44:002:033 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
           received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
           shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.

44:002:034 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
           himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right
           hand,

44:002:035 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

44:002:036 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
           hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
           and Christ.

44:002:037 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart,
           and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and
           brethren, what shall we do?

44:002:038 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
           of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
           and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

44:002:039 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
           that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall
           call.

44:002:040 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
           Save yourselves from this untoward generation.

44:002:041 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
           same day there were added unto them about three thousand
           souls.

44:002:042 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
           fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

44:002:043 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
           done by the apostles.

44:002:044 And all that believed were together, and had all things
           common;

44:002:045 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
           men, as every man had need.

44:002:046 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
           breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
           gladness and singleness of heart,

44:002:047 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
           Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

44:003:001 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
           hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.

44:003:002 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
           whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
           Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;

44:003:003 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an
           alms.

44:003:004 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
           on us.

44:003:005 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
           them.

44:003:006 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
           have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
           up and walk.

44:003:007 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
           immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

44:003:008 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
           into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

44:003:009 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

44:003:010 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
           Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder
           and amazement at that which had happened unto him.

44:003:011 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all
           the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
           Solomon's, greatly wondering.

44:003:012 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
           Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
           us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
           man to walk?

44:003:013 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
           fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
           and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
           determined to let him go.

44:003:014 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
           murderer to be granted unto you;

44:003:015 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
           dead; whereof we are witnesses.

44:003:016 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
           strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
           hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
           all.

44:003:017 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as
           did also your rulers.

44:003:018 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of
           all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
           fulfilled.

44:003:019 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
           blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
           presence of the Lord.

44:003:020 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
           you:

44:003:021 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of
           all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
           prophets since the world began.

44:003:022 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
           Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
           me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say
           unto you.

44:003:023 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not
           hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

44:003:024 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
           after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
           days.

44:003:025 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
           God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy
           seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

44:003:026 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
           to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
           iniquities.

44:004:001 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the
           captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

44:004:002 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached
           through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

44:004:003 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the
           next day: for it was now eventide.

44:004:004 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the
           number of the men was about five thousand.

44:004:005 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and
           elders, and scribes,

44:004:006 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
           Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high
           priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

44:004:007 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
           power, or by what name, have ye done this?

44:004:008 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
           rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

44:004:009 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the
           impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

44:004:010 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
           that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye
           crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth
           this man stand here before you whole.

44:004:011 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
           which is become the head of the corner.

44:004:012 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
           other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
           saved.

44:004:013 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
           perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
           marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been
           with Jesus.

44:004:014 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
           they could say nothing against it.

44:004:015 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the
           council, they conferred among themselves,

44:004:016 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a
           notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them
           that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

44:004:017 But that it spread no further among the people, let us
           straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man
           in this name.

44:004:018 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
           nor teach in the name of Jesus.

44:004:019 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
           right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
           God, judge ye.

44:004:020 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
           heard.

44:004:021 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
           finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
           people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.

44:004:022 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
           healing was shewed.

44:004:023 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
           all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

44:004:024 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
           with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

44:004:025 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
           heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

44:004:026 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
           together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

44:004:027 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
           anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
           and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

44:004:028 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
           before to be done.

44:004:029 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
           servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

44:004:030 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
           wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

44:004:031 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
           assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy
           Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

44:004:032 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
           of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things
           which he possessed was his own; but they had all things
           common.

44:004:033 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
           resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them
           all.

44:004:034 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as
           were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the
           prices of the things that were sold,

44:004:035 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was
           made unto every man according as he had need.

44:004:036 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which
           is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and
           of the country of Cyprus,

44:004:037 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at
           the apostles' feet.

44:005:001 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold
           a possession,

44:005:002 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to
           it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'
           feet.

44:005:003 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to
           lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of
           the land?

44:005:004 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was
           sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived
           this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but
           unto God.

44:005:005 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the
           ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these
           things.

44:005:006 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out,
           and buried him.

44:005:007 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his
           wife, not knowing what was done, came in.

44:005:008 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land
           for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

44:005:009 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed
           together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of
           them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall
           carry thee out.

44:005:010 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
           ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and,
           carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.

44:005:011 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
           heard these things.

44:005:012 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
           wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord
           in Solomon's porch.

44:005:013 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
           people magnified them.

44:005:014 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both
           of men and women.)

44:005:015 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
           and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the
           shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

44:005:016 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
           Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with
           unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.

44:005:017 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
           (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
           indignation,

44:005:018 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the
           common prison.

44:005:019 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
           and brought them forth, and said,

44:005:020 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
           of this life.

44:005:021 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early
           in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they
           that were with him, and called the council together, and all
           the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison
           to have them brought.

44:005:022 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
           they returned and told,

44:005:023 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
           the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had
           opened, we found no man within.

44:005:024 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
           chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them
           whereunto this would grow.

44:005:025 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye
           put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the
           people.

44:005:026 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
           without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should
           have been stoned.

44:005:027 And when they had brought them, they set them before the
           council: and the high priest asked them,

44:005:028 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not
           teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with
           your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

44:005:029 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
           to obey God rather than men.

44:005:030 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and
           hanged on a tree.

44:005:031 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
           Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
           sins.

44:005:032 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
           Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

44:005:033 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
           counsel to slay them.

44:005:034 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
           Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the
           people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little
           space;

44:005:035 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
           what ye intend to do as touching these men.

44:005:036 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
           somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
           themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,
           were scattered, and brought to nought.

44:005:037 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
           taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished;
           and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

44:005:038 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
           alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
           come to nought:

44:005:039 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be
           found even to fight against God.

44:005:040 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
           and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
           the name of Jesus, and let them go.

44:005:041 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
           that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

44:005:042 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not
           to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

44:006:001 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
           multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against
           the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily
           ministration.

44:006:002 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto
           them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
           of God, and serve tables.

44:006:003 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
           report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
           over this business.

44:006:004 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
           ministry of the word.

44:006:005 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
           Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and
           Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas,
           and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:

44:006:006 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
           they laid their hands on them.

44:006:007 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
           multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the
           priests were obedient to the faith.

44:006:008 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
           miracles among the people.

44:006:009 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
           synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
           and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

44:006:010 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
           which he spake.

44:006:011 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
           blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

44:006:012 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the
           scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to
           the council,

44:006:013 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
           to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the
           law:

44:006:014 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
           destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
           delivered us.

44:006:015 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him,
           saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

44:007:001 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

44:007:002 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
           glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in
           Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

44:007:003 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
           kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

44:007:004 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
           Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed
           him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

44:007:005 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to
           set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him
           for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he
           had no child.

44:007:006 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
           strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
           and entreat them evil four hundred years.

44:007:007 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
           said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me
           in this place.

44:007:008 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
           begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
           begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.

44:007:009 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
           but God was with him,

44:007:010 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
           favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and
           he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

44:007:011 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and
           Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no
           sustenance.

44:007:012 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
           our fathers first.

44:007:013 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren;
           and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

44:007:014 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all
           his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

44:007:015 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

44:007:016 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
           that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor
           the father of Sychem.

44:007:017 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
           sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

44:007:018 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.

44:007:019 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated
           our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to
           the end they might not live.

44:007:020 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
           nourished up in his father's house three months:

44:007:021 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and
           nourished him for her own son.

44:007:022 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
           was mighty in words and in deeds.

44:007:023 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
           to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

44:007:024 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and
           avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

44:007:025 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
           God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

44:007:026 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove,
           and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are
           brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?

44:007:027 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
           Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

44:007:028 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

44:007:029 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land
           of Madian, where he begat two sons.

44:007:030 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
           the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame
           of fire in a bush.

44:007:031 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew
           near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,

44:007:032 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and
           the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
           and durst not behold.

44:007:033 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet:
           for the place where thou standest is holy ground.

44:007:034 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is
           in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to
           deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

44:007:035 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
           and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a
           deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in
           the bush.

44:007:036 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and
           signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the
           wilderness forty years.

44:007:037 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
           prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
           brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.

44:007:038 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
           angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our
           fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:

44:007:039 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them,
           and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

44:007:040 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for
           this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot
           not what is become of him.

44:007:041 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
           the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

44:007:042 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of
           heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye
           house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and
           sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?

44:007:043 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your
           god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will
           carry you away beyond Babylon.

44:007:044 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
           as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make
           it according to the fashion that he had seen.

44:007:045 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus
           into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before
           the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;

44:007:046 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle
           for the God of Jacob.

44:007:047 But Solomon built him an house.

44:007:048 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
           as saith the prophet,

44:007:049 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house
           will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my
           rest?

44:007:050 Hath not my hand made all these things?

44:007:051 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
           always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.

44:007:052 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and
           they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the
           Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and
           murderers:

44:007:053 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and
           have not kept it.

44:007:054 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
           they gnashed on him with their teeth.

44:007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
           into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on
           the right hand of God,

44:007:056 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
           standing on the right hand of God.

44:007:057 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
           and ran upon him with one accord,

44:007:058 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the
           witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
           name was Saul.

44:007:059 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
           Jesus, receive my spirit.

44:007:060 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
           not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he
           fell asleep.

44:008:001 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
           was a great persecution against the church which was at
           Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the
           regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

44:008:002 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
           lamentation over him.

44:008:003 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
           house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

44:008:004 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
           preaching the word.

44:008:005 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
           Christ unto them.

44:008:006 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
           which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
           did.

44:008:007 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
           that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies,
           and that were lame, were healed.

44:008:008 And there was great joy in that city.

44:008:009 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in
           the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of
           Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

44:008:010 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
           saying, This man is the great power of God.

44:008:011 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
           bewitched them with sorceries.

44:008:012 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
           the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
           baptized, both men and women.

44:008:013 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
           continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
           and signs which were done.

44:008:014 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that
           Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them
           Peter and John:

44:008:015 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they
           might receive the Holy Ghost:

44:008:016 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
           baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

44:008:017 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
           Ghost.

44:008:018 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
           hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

44:008:019 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
           hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

44:008:020 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
           thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
           money.

44:008:021 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart
           is not right in the sight of God.

44:008:022 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
           perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

44:008:023 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
           the bond of iniquity.

44:008:024 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me,
           that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

44:008:025 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
           Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many
           villages of the Samaritans.

44:008:026 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
           and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
           Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.

44:008:027 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
           eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the
           Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had
           come to Jerusalem for to worship,

44:008:028 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
           prophet.

44:008:029 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
           this chariot.

44:008:030 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
           Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

44:008:031 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
           he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

44:008:032 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led
           as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his
           shearer, so opened he not his mouth:

44:008:033 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
           declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

44:008:034 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
           speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

44:008:035 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
           and preached unto him Jesus.

44:008:036 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
           and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me
           to be baptized?

44:008:037 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
           mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ
           is the Son of God.

44:008:038 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
           down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
           baptized him.

44:008:039 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
           Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and
           he went on his way rejoicing.

44:008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he
           preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

44:009:001 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
           the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

44:009:002 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
           if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
           he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

44:009:003 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
           shined round about him a light from heaven:

44:009:004 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:009:005 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
           whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
           pricks.

44:009:006 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
           have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
           the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

44:009:007 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
           a voice, but seeing no man.

44:009:008 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
           he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him
           into Damascus.

44:009:009 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
           drink.

44:009:010 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
           and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
           Behold, I am here, Lord.

44:009:011 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street
           which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas
           for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

44:009:012 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and
           putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

44:009:013 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
           how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

44:009:014 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all
           that call on thy name.

44:009:015 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
           vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and
           kings, and the children of Israel:

44:009:016 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my
           name's sake.

44:009:017 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
           putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
           Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath
           sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled
           with the Holy Ghost.

44:009:018 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been
           scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
           baptized.

44:009:019 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
           Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

44:009:020 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he
           is the Son of God.

44:009:021 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he
           that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
           and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them
           bound unto the chief priests?

44:009:022 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
           Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very
           Christ.

44:009:023 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
           to kill him:

44:009:024 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the
           gates day and night to kill him.

44:009:025 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
           wall in a basket.

44:009:026 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join
           himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and
           believed not that he was a disciple.

44:009:027 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
           declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
           that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at
           Damascus in the name of Jesus.

44:009:028 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

44:009:029 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
           disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay
           him.

44:009:030 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to
           Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

44:009:031 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee
           and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the
           Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

44:009:032 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,
           he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

44:009:033 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept
           his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

44:009:034 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee
           whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

44:009:035 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to
           the Lord.

44:009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which
           by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of
           good works and almsdeeds which she did.

44:009:037 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and
           died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
           chamber.

44:009:038 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples
           had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men,
           desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.

44:009:039 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
           brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood
           by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which
           Dorcas made, while she was with them.

44:009:040 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
           and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
           opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

44:009:041 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
           called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

44:009:042 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in
           the Lord.

44:009:043 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with
           one Simon a tanner.

44:010:001 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a
           centurion of the band called the Italian band,

44:010:002 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house,
           which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

44:010:003 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
           an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him,
           Cornelius.

44:010:004 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
           it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are
           come up for a memorial before God.

44:010:005 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
           surname is Peter:

44:010:006 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
           side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

44:010:007 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
           called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of
           them that waited on him continually;

44:010:008 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent
           them to Joppa.

44:010:009 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
           unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about
           the sixth hour:

44:010:010 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
           they made ready, he fell into a trance,

44:010:011 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon
           him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners,
           and let down to the earth:

44:010:012 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
           wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:010:013 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

44:010:014 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
           that is common or unclean.

44:010:015 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
           hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:010:016 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
           into heaven.

44:010:017 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
           had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
           Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
           the gate,

44:010:018 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
           were lodged there.

44:010:019 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
           Behold, three men seek thee.

44:010:020 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
           nothing: for I have sent them.

44:010:021 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
           Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the
           cause wherefore ye are come?

44:010:022 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
           that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of
           the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
           thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

44:010:023 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
           Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
           accompanied him.

44:010:024 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
           waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and
           near friends.

44:010:025 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
           at his feet, and worshipped him.

44:010:026 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a
           man.

44:010:027 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that
           were come together.

44:010:028 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
           thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto
           one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should
           not call any man common or unclean.

44:010:029 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
           sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

44:010:030 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
           hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold,
           a man stood before me in bright clothing,

44:010:031 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are
           had in remembrance in the sight of God.

44:010:032 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname
           is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by
           the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

44:010:033 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
           that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
           before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

44:010:034 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
           that God is no respecter of persons:

44:010:035 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
           righteousness, is accepted with him.

44:010:036 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
           peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

44:010:037 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all
           Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
           preached;

44:010:038 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
           with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that
           were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

44:010:039 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
           land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged
           on a tree:

44:010:040 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

44:010:041 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God,
           even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from
           the dead.

44:010:042 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
           that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
           quick and dead.

44:010:043 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
           whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

44:010:044 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
           them which heard the word.

44:010:045 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
           as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
           was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

44:010:046 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
           answered Peter,

44:010:047 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
           which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

44:010:048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
           Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

44:011:001 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
           the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

44:011:002 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
           circumcision contended with him,

44:011:003 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
           with them.

44:011:004 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and
           expounded it by order unto them, saying,

44:011:005 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
           vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great
           sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even
           to me:

44:011:006 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
           and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
           creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:011:007 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
           eat.

44:011:008 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
           at any time entered into my mouth.

44:011:009 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
           cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:011:010 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
           into heaven.

44:011:011 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
           unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

44:011:012 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
           Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered
           into the man's house:

44:011:013 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
           stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
           Simon, whose surname is Peter;

44:011:014 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
           shall be saved.

44:011:015 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
           at the beginning.

44:011:016 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
           indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the
           Holy Ghost.

44:011:017 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto
           us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
           could withstand God?

44:011:018 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
           glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles
           granted repentance unto life.

44:011:019 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
           arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
           and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews
           only.

44:011:020 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
           they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
           the LORD Jesus.

44:011:021 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
           believed, and turned unto the Lord.

44:011:022 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
           which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he
           should go as far as Antioch.

44:011:023 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
           and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
           cleave unto the Lord.

44:011:024 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of
           faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

44:011:025 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

44:011:026 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it
           came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
           the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
           called Christians first in Antioch.

44:011:027 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

44:011:028 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
           the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all
           the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

44:011:029 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
           determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
           Judaea:

44:011:030 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
           Barnabas and Saul.

44:012:001 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
           to vex certain of the church.

44:012:002 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

44:012:003 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
           to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)

44:012:004 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
           delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;
           intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

44:012:005 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
           without ceasing of the church unto God for him.

44:012:006 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
           Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
           chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.

44:012:007 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
           shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and
           raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell
           off from his hands.

44:012:008 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
           sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy
           garment about thee, and follow me.

44:012:009 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
           true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

44:012:010 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
           unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
           them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on
           through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.

44:012:011 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
           surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
           me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
           the people of the Jews.

44:012:012 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
           Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
           were gathered together praying.

44:012:013 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
           hearken, named Rhoda.

44:012:014 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
           gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the
           gate.

44:012:015 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
           affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

44:012:016 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the
           door, and saw him, they were astonished.

44:012:017 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
           declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the
           prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to
           the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

44:012:018 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
           soldiers, what was become of Peter.

44:012:019 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
           examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
           death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there
           abode.

44:012:020 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
           but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
           the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because
           their country was nourished by the king's country.

44:012:021 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
           his throne, and made an oration unto them.

44:012:022 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
           and not of a man.

44:012:023 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
           gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up
           the ghost.

44:012:024 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

44:012:025 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
           fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose
           surname was Mark.

44:013:001 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain
           prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called
           Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been
           brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

44:013:002 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
           said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I
           have called them.

44:013:003 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
           them, they sent them away.

44:013:004 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
           Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

44:013:005 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
           in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their
           minister.

44:013:006 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they
           found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
           was Barjesus:

44:013:007 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
           prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to
           hear the word of God.

44:013:008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
           withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the
           faith.

44:013:009 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy
           Ghost, set his eyes on him.

44:013:010 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child
           of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not
           cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

44:013:011 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
           shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
           immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he
           went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

44:013:012 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
           astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

44:013:013 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
           Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to
           Jerusalem.

44:013:014 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
           Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
           sat down.

44:013:015 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers
           of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren,
           if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

44:013:016 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
           Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

44:013:017 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and
           exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of
           Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.

44:013:018 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
           the wilderness.

44:013:019 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of
           Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.

44:013:020 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of
           four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

44:013:021 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
           the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
           of forty years.

44:013:022 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to
           be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said,
           I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own
           heart, which shall fulfil all my will.

44:013:023 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised
           unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

44:013:024 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
           repentance to all the people of Israel.

44:013:025 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that
           I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me,
           whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

44:013:026 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
           whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this
           salvation sent.

44:013:027 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
           they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which
           are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in
           condemning him.

44:013:028 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired
           they Pilate that he should be slain.

44:013:029 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
           took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

44:013:030 But God raised him from the dead:

44:013:031 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
           Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

44:013:032 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
           which was made unto the fathers,

44:013:033 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he
           hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the
           second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

44:013:034 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
           more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will
           give you the sure mercies of David.

44:013:035 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

44:013:036 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
           of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw
           corruption:

44:013:037 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

44:013:038 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
           this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

44:013:039 And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
           from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

44:013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of
           in the prophets;

44:013:041 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
           work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
           though a man declare it unto you.

44:013:042 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
           besought that these words might be preached to them the next
           sabbath.

44:013:043 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
           religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
           to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44:013:044 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
           to hear the word of God.

44:013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
           envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by
           Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

44:013:046 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
           that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but
           seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
           everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

44:013:047 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to
           be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
           salvation unto the ends of the earth.

44:013:048 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and
           glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained
           to eternal life believed.

44:013:049 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
           region.

44:013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
           the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul
           and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.

44:013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
           came unto Iconium.

44:013:052 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
           Ghost.

44:014:001 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
           into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great
           multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

44:014:002 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
           their minds evil affected against the brethren.

44:014:003 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
           which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
           signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

44:014:004 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
           the Jews, and part with the apostles.

44:014:005 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
           also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully,
           and to stone them,

44:014:006 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities
           of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

44:014:007 And there they preached the gospel.

44:014:008 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
           being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

44:014:009 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
           perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

44:014:010 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
           leaped and walked.

44:014:011 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
           their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are
           come down to us in the likeness of men.

44:014:012 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
           because he was the chief speaker.

44:014:013 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
           brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done
           sacrifice with the people.

44:014:014 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
           rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

44:014:015 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
           like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should
           turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
           therein:

44:014:016 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
           ways.

44:014:017 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
           did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
           filling our hearts with food and gladness.

44:014:018 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
           they had not done sacrifice unto them.

44:014:019 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
           who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out
           of the city, supposing he had been dead.

44:014:020 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
           and came into the city: and the next day he departed with
           Barnabas to Derbe.

44:014:021 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
           taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,
           and Antioch,

44:014:022 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
           continue in the faith, and that we must through much
           tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

44:014:023 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and
           had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
           whom they believed.

44:014:024 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
           Pamphylia.

44:014:025 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
           into Attalia:

44:014:026 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been
           recommended to the grace of God for the work which they
           fulfilled.

44:014:027 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
           they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had
           opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

44:014:028 And there they abode long time with the disciples.

44:015:001 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the
           brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner
           of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

44:015:002 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
           disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,
           and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the
           apostles and elders about this question.

44:015:003 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed
           through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the
           Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.

44:015:004 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
           the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared
           all things that God had done with them.

44:015:005 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
           believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and
           to command them to keep the law of Moses.

44:015:006 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
           this matter.

44:015:007 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
           said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good
           while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my
           mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

44:015:008 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
           them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;

44:015:009 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
           hearts by faith.

44:015:010 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
           the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
           bear?

44:015:011 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
           we shall be saved, even as they.

44:015:012 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
           Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
           wrought among the Gentiles by them.

44:015:013 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
           Men and brethren, hearken unto me:

44:015:014 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
           Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

44:015:015 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

44:015:016 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
           of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the
           ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

44:015:017 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
           Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who
           doeth all these things.

44:015:018 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
           world.

44:015:019 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
           among the Gentiles are turned to God:

44:015:020 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
           of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and
           from blood.

44:015:021 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
           being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

44:015:022 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
           to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul
           and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief
           men among the brethren:

44:015:023 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles
           and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
           are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

44:015:024 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
           us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
           saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we
           gave no such commandment:

44:015:025 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
           send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

44:015:026 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
           Jesus Christ.

44:015:027 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
           you the same things by mouth.

44:015:028 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
           you no greater burden than these necessary things;

44:015:029 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if
           ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

44:015:030 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
           they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
           epistle:

44:015:031 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

44:015:032 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
           the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

44:015:033 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
           peace from the brethren unto the apostles.

44:015:034 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

44:015:035 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
           preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

44:015:036 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
           and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached
           the word of the LORD, and see how they do.

44:015:037 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
           was Mark.

44:015:038 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
           from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

44:015:039 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they
           departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took
           Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;

44:015:040 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
           brethren unto the grace of God.

44:015:041 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
           churches.

44:016:001 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
           disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain
           woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a
           Greek:

44:016:002 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
           and Iconium.

44:016:003 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
           circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those
           quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.

44:016:004 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
           decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and
           elders which were at Jerusalem.

44:016:005 And so were the churches established in the faith, and
           increased in number daily.

44:016:006 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
           Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the
           word in Asia,

44:016:007 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
           Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

44:016:008 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

44:016:009 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
           of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
           Macedonia, and help us.

44:016:010 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
           to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
           called us for to preach the gospel unto them.

44:016:011 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
           to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

44:016:012 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
           part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city
           abiding certain days.

44:016:013 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
           where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
           unto the women which resorted thither.

44:016:014 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
           city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart
           the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
           spoken of Paul.

44:016:015 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
           saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
           into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

44:016:016 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
           possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought
           her masters much gain by soothsaying:

44:016:017 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
           are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the
           way of salvation.

44:016:018 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
           and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
           Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

44:016:019 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
           gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the
           marketplace unto the rulers,

44:016:020 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being
           Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

44:016:021 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
           neither to observe, being Romans.

44:016:022 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
           magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat
           them.

44:016:023 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
           into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

44:016:024 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
           prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

44:016:025 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
           God: and the prisoners heard them.

44:016:026 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
           foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
           doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

44:016:027 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
           seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
           have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been
           fled.

44:016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
           for we are all here.

44:016:029 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
           and fell down before Paul and Silas,

44:016:030 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
           saved?

44:016:031 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
           shalt be saved, and thy house.

44:016:032 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
           were in his house.

44:016:033 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
           stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

44:016:034 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
           before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
           house.

44:016:035 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
           saying, Let those men go.

44:016:036 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
           magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and
           go in peace.

44:016:037 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly
           uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and
           now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them
           come themselves and fetch us out.

44:016:038 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
           they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

44:016:039 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
           desired them to depart out of the city.

44:016:040 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
           Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
           them, and departed.

44:017:001 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
           they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

44:017:002 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
           sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

44:017:003 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
           and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I
           preach unto you, is Christ.

44:017:004 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
           and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
           women not a few.

44:017:005 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
           them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
           company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
           house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

44:017:006 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
           brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have
           turned the world upside down are come hither also;

44:017:007 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
           decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one
           Jesus.

44:017:008 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
           they heard these things.

44:017:009 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
           they let them go.

44:017:010 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
           unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
           Jews.

44:017:011 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
           received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
           scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

44:017:012 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
           which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

44:017:013 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
           of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
           and stirred up the people.

44:017:014 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
           were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

44:017:015 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
           receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
           to him with all speed, they departed.

44:017:016 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
           stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

44:017:017 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
           the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met
           with him.

44:017:018 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
           Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this
           babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of
           strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the
           resurrection.

44:017:019 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
           we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

44:017:020 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
           know therefore what these things mean.

44:017:021 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
           their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear
           some new thing.)

44:017:022 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men
           of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
           superstitious.

44:017:023 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
           altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
           therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

44:017:024 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
           is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
           hands;

44:017:025 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
           any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
           things;

44:017:026 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
           all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
           before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;

44:017:027 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
           him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:

44:017:028 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
           also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
           offspring.

44:017:029 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
           think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
           graven by art and man's device.

44:017:030 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
           commandeth all men every where to repent:

44:017:031 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
           the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
           whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
           raised him from the dead.

44:017:032 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
           mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this
           matter.

44:017:033 So Paul departed from among them.

44:017:034 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
           which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
           and others with them.

44:018:001 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
           Corinth;

44:018:002 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
           come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that
           Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came
           unto them.

44:018:003 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
           wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

44:018:004 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
           the Jews and the Greeks.

44:018:005 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
           was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that
           Jesus was Christ.

44:018:006 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
           raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
           heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the
           Gentiles.

44:018:007 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's
           house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house
           joined hard to the synagogue.

44:018:008 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
           Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
           believed, and were baptized.

44:018:009 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
           afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

44:018:010 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
           for I have much people in this city.

44:018:011 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the
           word of God among them.

44:018:012 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
           insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to
           the judgment seat,

44:018:013 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to
           the law.

44:018:014 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said
           unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked
           lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

44:018:015 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
           look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

44:018:016 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

44:018:017 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
           synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio
           cared for none of those things.

44:018:018 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
           took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
           and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in
           Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

44:018:019 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
           entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

44:018:020 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
           consented not;

44:018:021 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
           feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
           you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

44:018:022 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
           the church, he went down to Antioch.

44:018:023 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
           over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
           strengthening all the disciples.

44:018:024 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
           eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

44:018:025 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
           fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the
           things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

44:018:026 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when
           Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and
           expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

44:018:027 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
           wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he
           was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

44:018:028 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly,
           shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

44:019:001 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
           having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and
           finding certain disciples,

44:019:002 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
           believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
           whether there be any Holy Ghost.

44:019:003 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And
           they said, Unto John's baptism.

44:019:004 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
           repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe
           on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

44:019:005 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
           Lord Jesus.

44:019:006 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
           came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

44:019:007 And all the men were about twelve.

44:019:008 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
           of three months, disputing and persuading the things
           concerning the kingdom of God.

44:019:009 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
           evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
           and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of
           one Tyrannus.

44:019:010 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
           which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both
           Jews and Greeks.

44:019:011 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

44:019:012 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
           or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil
           spirits went out of them.

44:019:013 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
           to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD
           Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

44:019:014 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of
           the priests, which did so.

44:019:015 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
           I know; but who are ye?

44:019:016 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
           overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
           out of that house naked and wounded.

44:019:017 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
           Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
           Jesus was magnified.

44:019:018 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
           deeds.

44:019:019 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
           together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the
           price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

44:019:020 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

44:019:021 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
           when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
           Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see
           Rome.

44:019:022 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
           him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for
           a season.

44:019:023 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

44:019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
           silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
           craftsmen;

44:019:025 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
           and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

44:019:026 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but
           almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and
           turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which
           are made with hands:

44:019:027 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
           nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
           should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed,
           whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.

44:019:028 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
           and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

44:019:029 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having
           caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's
           companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the
           theatre.

44:019:030 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
           disciples suffered him not.

44:019:031 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
           unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself
           into the theatre.

44:019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
           assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore
           they were come together.

44:019:033 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
           him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would
           have made his defence unto the people.

44:019:034 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
           the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the
           Ephesians.

44:019:035 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
           men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that
           the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess
           Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?

44:019:036 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
           ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

44:019:037 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither
           robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

44:019:038 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
           have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
           deputies: let them implead one another.

44:019:039 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
           be determined in a lawful assembly.

44:019:040 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
           uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of
           this concourse.

44:019:041 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

44:020:001 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
           disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into
           Macedonia.

44:020:002 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
           exhortation, he came into Greece,

44:020:003 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
           him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return
           through Macedonia.

44:020:004 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
           the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of
           Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

44:020:005 These going before tarried for us at Troas.

44:020:006 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
           bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we
           abode seven days.

44:020:007 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
           together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to
           depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

44:020:008 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
           were gathered together.

44:020:009 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
           being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long
           preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the
           third loft, and was taken up dead.

44:020:010 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
           Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

44:020:011 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
           eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
           departed.

44:020:012 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
           comforted.

44:020:013 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
           intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding
           himself to go afoot.

44:020:014 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
           Mitylene.

44:020:015 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against
           Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at
           Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.

44:020:016 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
           not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
           for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

44:020:017 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
           the church.

44:020:018 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
           from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
           have been with you at all seasons,

44:020:019 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many
           tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
           of the Jews:

44:020:020 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but
           have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house
           to house,

44:020:021 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
           repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

44:020:022 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
           knowing the things that shall befall me there:

44:020:023 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
           bonds and afflictions abide me.

44:020:024 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
           unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
           the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
           testify the gospel of the grace of God.

44:020:025 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
           preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

44:020:026 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
           the blood of all men.

44:020:027 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
           God.

44:020:028 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
           over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
           the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

44:020:029 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
           enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

44:020:030 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
           things, to draw away disciples after them.

44:020:031 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
           years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

44:020:032 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
           his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
           inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

44:020:033 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

44:020:034 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
           my necessities, and to them that were with me.

44:020:035 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
           to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
           Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to
           receive.

44:020:036 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
           them all.

44:020:037 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed
           him,

44:020:038 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
           should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the
           ship.

44:021:001 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and
           had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and
           the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

44:021:002 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
           and set forth.

44:021:003 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left
           hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the
           ship was to unlade her burden.

44:021:004 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
           to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:005 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
           our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and
           children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
           the shore, and prayed.

44:021:006 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
           and they returned home again.

44:021:007 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
           Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one
           day.

44:021:008 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
           came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip
           the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with
           him.

44:021:009 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
           prophesy.

44:021:010 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
           a certain prophet, named Agabus.

44:021:011 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
           his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
           So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this
           girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

44:021:012 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
           place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

44:021:013 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
           heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
           Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

44:021:014 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
           will of the Lord be done.

44:021:015 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:016 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
           and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,
           with whom we should lodge.

44:021:017 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
           gladly.

44:021:018 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
           the elders were present.

44:021:019 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
           things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

44:021:020 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
           him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are
           which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:

44:021:021 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
           which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
           they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
           after the customs.

44:021:022 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
           for they will hear that thou art come.

44:021:023 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
           have a vow on them;

44:021:024 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
           with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know
           that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
           are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and
           keepest the law.

44:021:025 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
           concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they
           keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from strangled, and from fornication.

44:021:026 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
           with them entered into the temple, to signify the
           accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an
           offering should be offered for every one of them.

44:021:027 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
           of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
           people, and laid hands on him,

44:021:028 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
           teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law,
           and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the
           temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

44:021:029 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
           Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
           temple.)

44:021:030 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
           they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith
           the doors were shut.

44:021:031 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
           chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an
           uproar.

44:021:032 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
           unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the
           soldiers, they left beating of Paul.

44:021:033 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
           him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and
           what he had done.

44:021:034 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
           and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he
           commanded him to be carried into the castle.

44:021:035 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
           of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

44:021:036 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
           with him.

44:021:037 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
           chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou
           speak Greek?

44:021:038 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
           uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
           that were murderers?

44:021:039 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee,
           suffer me to speak unto the people.

44:021:040 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
           and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
           made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
           saying,

44:022:001 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make
           now unto you.

44:022:002 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
           them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)

44:022:003 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
           and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
           fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.

44:022:004 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
           delivering into prisons both men and women.

44:022:005 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the
           estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto
           the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were
           there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.

44:022:006 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
           nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from
           heaven a great light round about me.

44:022:007 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:022:008 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am
           Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

44:022:009 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
           afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

44:022:010 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
           Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
           of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

44:022:011 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
           led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into
           Damascus.

44:022:012 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
           good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

44:022:013 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul,
           receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

44:022:014 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
           thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
           shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

44:022:015 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
           seen and heard.

44:022:016 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
           away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

44:022:017 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
           even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

44:022:018 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
           out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony
           concerning me.

44:022:019 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
           every synagogue them that believed on thee:

44:022:020 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
           standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
           raiment of them that slew him.

44:022:021 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
           unto the Gentiles.

44:022:022 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
           their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the
           earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

44:022:023 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
           dust into the air,

44:022:024 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
           and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he
           might know wherefore they cried so against him.

44:022:025 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
           centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
           that is a Roman, and uncondemned?

44:022:026 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
           captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
           Roman.

44:022:027 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
           thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

44:022:028 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
           this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

44:022:029 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
           examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
           knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

44:022:030 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
           wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his
           bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council
           to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

44:023:001 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
           brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until
           this day.

44:023:002 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
           to smite him on the mouth.

44:023:003 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited
           wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and
           commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?

44:023:004 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?

44:023:005 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
           priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the
           ruler of thy people.

44:023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
           the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and
           brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope
           and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.

44:023:007 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
           Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

44:023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
           angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

44:023:009 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
           Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in
           this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
           us not fight against God.

44:023:010 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
           fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them,
           commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force
           from among them, and to bring him into the castle.

44:023:011 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
           good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in
           Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

44:023:012 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
           bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither
           eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

44:023:013 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

44:023:014 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We
           have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat
           nothing until we have slain Paul.

44:023:015 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
           that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would
           enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or
           ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

44:023:016 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
           went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

44:023:017 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said,
           Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
           certain thing to tell him.

44:023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and
           said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to
           bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
           thee.

44:023:019 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
           aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell
           me?

44:023:020 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
           wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though
           they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

44:023:021 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
           of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with
           an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have
           killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from
           thee.

44:023:022 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and
           charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these
           things to me.

44:023:023 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
           hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore
           and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the
           night;

44:023:024 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring
           him safe unto Felix the governor.

44:023:025 And he wrote a letter after this manner:

44:023:026 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
           greeting.

44:023:027 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
           them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
           understood that he was a Roman.

44:023:028 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
           him, I brought him forth into their council:

44:023:029 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but
           to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
           bonds.

44:023:030 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
           man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his
           accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.
           Farewell.

44:023:031 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
           brought him by night to Antipatris.

44:023:032 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
           returned to the castle:

44:023:033 Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to
           the governor, presented Paul also before him.

44:023:034 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
           province he was. And when he understood that he was of
           Cilicia;

44:023:035 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
           And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

44:024:001 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
           elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who
           informed the governor against Paul.

44:024:002 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
           saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that
           very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

44:024:003 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with
           all thankfulness.

44:024:004 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
           pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
           words.

44:024:005 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
           sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
           ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

44:024:006 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
           and would have judged according to our law.

44:024:007 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
           violence took him away out of our hands,

44:024:008 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
           whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
           whereof we accuse him.

44:024:009 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

44:024:010 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
           speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of
           many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
           answer for myself:

44:024:011 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
           twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

44:024:012 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
           man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues,
           nor in the city:

44:024:013 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

44:024:014 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
           call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
           things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

44:024:015 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
           that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
           just and unjust.

44:024:016 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
           void to offence toward God, and toward men.

44:024:017 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
           offerings.

44:024:018 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
           temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

44:024:019 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
           had ought against me.

44:024:020 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
           doing in me, while I stood before the council,

44:024:021 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
           them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in
           question by you this day.

44:024:022 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect
           knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias
           the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost
           of your matter.

44:024:023 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
           liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
           minister or come unto him.

44:024:024 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife
           Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him
           concerning the faith in Christ.

44:024:025 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
           to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
           time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

44:024:026 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
           that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the
           oftener, and communed with him.

44:024:027 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
           Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

44:025:001 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
           he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

44:025:002 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
           against Paul, and besought him,

44:025:003 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
           Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

44:025:004 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
           that he himself would depart shortly thither.

44:025:005 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
           with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in
           him.

44:025:006 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
           down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment
           seat commanded Paul to be brought.

44:025:007 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
           stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints
           against Paul, which they could not prove.

44:025:008 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
           Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have
           I offended any thing at all.

44:025:009 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
           and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
           these things before me?

44:025:010 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
           ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou
           very well knowest.

44:025:011 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
           death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these
           things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto
           them. I appeal unto Caesar.

44:025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
           Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

44:025:013 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
           Caesarea to salute Festus.

44:025:014 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's
           cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in
           bonds by Felix:

44:025:015 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
           elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
           against him.

44:025:016 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
           deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have
           the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for
           himself concerning the crime laid against him.

44:025:017 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on
           the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man
           to be brought forth.

44:025:018 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
           accusation of such things as I supposed:

44:025:019 But had certain questions against him of their own
           superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul
           affirmed to be alive.

44:025:020 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
           whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
           matters.

44:025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
           Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
           Caesar.

44:025:022 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man
           myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

44:025:023 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
           great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with
           the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus'
           commandment Paul was brought forth.

44:025:024 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
           present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude
           of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also
           here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

44:025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of
           death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have
           determined to send him.

44:025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
           Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
           before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
           might have somewhat to write.

44:025:027 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
           withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

44:026:001 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
           thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
           himself:

44:026:002 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
           myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I
           am accused of the Jews:

44:026:003 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
           questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
           to hear me patiently.

44:026:004 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
           mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

44:026:005 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
           after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a
           Pharisee.

44:026:006 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
           of God, unto our fathers:

44:026:007 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
           day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king
           Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

44:026:008 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
           should raise the dead?

44:026:009 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
           contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

44:026:010 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
           did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
           chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
           voice against them.

44:026:011 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
           to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
           persecuted them even unto strange cities.

44:026:012 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
           from the chief priests,

44:026:013 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
           the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them
           which journeyed with me.

44:026:014 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
           speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
           why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
           the pricks.

44:026:015 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
           thou persecutest.

44:026:016 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
           thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
           both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
           in the which I will appear unto thee;

44:026:017 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
           whom now I send thee,

44:026:018 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
           and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
           forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
           sanctified by faith that is in me.

44:026:019 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
           heavenly vision:

44:026:020 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
           throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
           that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
           repentance.

44:026:021 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
           about to kill me.

44:026:022 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
           day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other
           things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
           come:

44:026:023 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
           that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
           people, and to the Gentiles.

44:026:024 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
           voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make
           thee mad.

44:026:025 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
           the words of truth and soberness.

44:026:026 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
           freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are
           hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

44:026:027 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
           believest.

44:026:028 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
           Christian.

44:026:029 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
           all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether
           such as I am, except these bonds.

44:026:030 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
           governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

44:026:031 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
           saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

44:026:032 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
           liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

44:027:001 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
           they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named
           Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.

44:027:002 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
           to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian
           of Thessalonica, being with us.

44:027:003 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
           entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to
           refresh himself.

44:027:004 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
           because the winds were contrary.

44:027:005 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
           we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

44:027:006 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
           into Italy; and he put us therein.

44:027:007 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
           over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed
           under Crete, over against Salmone;

44:027:008 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
           fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

44:027:009 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now
           dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul
           admonished them,

44:027:010 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be
           with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,
           but also of our lives.

44:027:011 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner
           of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

44:027:012 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
           more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
           might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an
           haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north
           west.

44:027:013 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
           obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by
           Crete.

44:027:014 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
           called Euroclydon.

44:027:015 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
           wind, we let her drive.

44:027:016 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
           had much work to come by the boat:

44:027:017 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
           the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the
           quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

44:027:018 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
           they lightened the ship;

44:027:019 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling
           of the ship.

44:027:020 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
           small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was
           then taken away.

44:027:021 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
           them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and
           not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and
           loss.

44:027:022 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be
           no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

44:027:023 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
           and whom I serve,

44:027:024 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:
           and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

44:027:025 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
           shall be even as it was told me.

44:027:026 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

44:027:027 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up
           and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they
           drew near to some country;

44:027:028 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had
           gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
           fifteen fathoms.

44:027:029 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
           four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

44:027:030 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
           they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as
           though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,

44:027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
           abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.

44:027:032 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
           fall off.

44:027:033 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
           take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
           tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.

44:027:034 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
           health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any
           of you.

44:027:035 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
           God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he
           began to eat.

44:027:036 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
           meat.

44:027:037 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
           sixteen souls.

44:027:038 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
           cast out the wheat into the sea.

44:027:039 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
           discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they
           were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.

44:027:040 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
           themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
           hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

44:027:041 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
           aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
           but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

44:027:042 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any
           of them should swim out, and escape.

44:027:043 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
           purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
           themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

44:027:044 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the
           ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
           land.

44:028:001 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
           called Melita.

44:028:002 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
           they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
           present rain, and because of the cold.

44:028:003 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them
           on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened
           on his hand.

44:028:004 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his
           hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
           murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
           suffereth not to live.

44:028:005 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

44:028:006 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
           down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while,
           and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and
           said that he was a god.

44:028:007 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
           island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
           three days courteously.

44:028:008 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
           fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and
           prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

44:028:009 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
           island, came, and were healed:

44:028:010 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
           they laded us with such things as were necessary.

44:028:011 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
           which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and
           Pollux.

44:028:012 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

44:028:013 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
           after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
           Puteoli:

44:028:014 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
           seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

44:028:015 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
           meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
           when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

44:028:016 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
           prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered
           to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

44:028:017 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
           chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
           he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
           nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
           I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
           Romans.

44:028:018 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
           there was no cause of death in me.

44:028:019 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to
           appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation
           of.

44:028:020 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
           and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
           am bound with this chain.

44:028:021 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
           Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
           shewed or spake any harm of thee.

44:028:022 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
           concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
           against.

44:028:023 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
           into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
           kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
           the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
           evening.

44:028:024 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
           believed not.

44:028:025 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
           after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
           by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

44:028:026 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
           and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
           perceive:

44:028:027 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
           are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
           they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
           understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
           should heal them.

44:028:028 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
           sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

44:028:029 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
           great reasoning among themselves.

44:028:030 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
           received all that came in unto him,

44:028:031 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
           concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
           forbidding him.
Book 45        Romans

45:001:001 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
           separated unto the gospel of God,

45:001:002 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
           scriptures,)

45:001:003 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
           the seed of David according to the flesh;

45:001:004 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
           spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

45:001:005 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
           to the faith among all nations, for his name:

45:001:006 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

45:001:007 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
           Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
           Christ.

45:001:008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
           your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

45:001:009 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
           gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
           always in my prayers;

45:001:010 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
           prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

45:001:011 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
           spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

45:001:012 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
           mutual faith both of you and me.

45:001:013 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
           purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I
           might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
           Gentiles.

45:001:014 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
           the wise, and to the unwise.

45:001:015 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
           you that are at Rome also.

45:001:016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
           power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to
           the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

45:001:017 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
           faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

45:001:018 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
           ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
           unrighteousness;

45:001:019 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
           for God hath shewed it unto them.

45:001:020 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
           are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
           made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
           without excuse:

45:001:021 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as
           God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
           imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

45:001:022 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

45:001:023 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
           made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted
           beasts, and creeping things.

45:001:024 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
           lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
           between themselves:

45:001:025 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
           served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for
           ever. Amen.

45:001:026 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
           their women did change the natural use into that which is
           against nature:

45:001:027 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
           woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
           working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
           that recompence of their error which was meet.

45:001:028 And even as they did not like to retain God in their
           knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
           things which are not convenient;

45:001:029 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
           wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
           debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

45:001:030 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
           inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

45:001:031 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
           affection, implacable, unmerciful:

45:001:032 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
           things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
           pleasure in them that do them.

45:002:001 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
           judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
           thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

45:002:002 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
           against them which commit such things.

45:002:003 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
           things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
           judgment of God?

45:002:004 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
           and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
           leadeth thee to repentance?

45:002:005 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
           thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
           righteous judgment of God;

45:002:006 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

45:002:007 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
           glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

45:002:008 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
           but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

45:002:009 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
           evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

45:002:010 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,
           to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

45:002:011 For there is no respect of persons with God.

45:002:012 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
           without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
           judged by the law;

45:002:013 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
           doers of the law shall be justified.

45:002:014 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
           the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
           are a law unto themselves:

45:002:015 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
           conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
           while accusing or else excusing one another;)

45:002:016 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
           Christ according to my gospel.

45:002:017 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
           makest thy boast of God,

45:002:018 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
           excellent, being instructed out of the law;

45:002:019 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
           a light of them which are in darkness,

45:002:020 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
           the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

45:002:021 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
           thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
           steal?

45:002:022 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
           commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
           sacrilege?

45:002:023 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
           law dishonourest thou God?

45:002:024 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
           you, as it is written.

45:002:025 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
           if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
           uncircumcision.

45:002:026 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
           law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

45:002:027 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil
           the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
           transgress the law?

45:002:028 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
           circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

45:002:029 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
           that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose
           praise is not of men, but of God.

45:003:001 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
           circumcision?

45:003:002 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed
           the oracles of God.

45:003:003 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
           the faith of God without effect?

45:003:004 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it
           is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
           and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

45:003:005 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
           what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
           speak as a man)

45:003:006 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

45:003:007 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
           his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

45:003:008 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
           affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
           damnation is just.

45:003:009 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
           have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
           under sin;

45:003:010 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

45:003:011 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
           after God.

45:003:012 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
           unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

45:003:013 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
           have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

45:003:014 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

45:003:015 Their feet are swift to shed blood:

45:003:016 Destruction and misery are in their ways:

45:003:017 And the way of peace have they not known:

45:003:018 There is no fear of God before their eyes.

45:003:019 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
           them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
           and all the world may become guilty before God.

45:003:020 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
           justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
           sin.

45:003:021 But now the righteousness of God without the law is
           manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

45:003:022 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
           Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is
           no difference:

45:003:023 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

45:003:024 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
           that is in Christ Jesus:

45:003:025 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
           his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
           sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

45:003:026 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
           might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
           Jesus.

45:003:027 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
           Nay: but by the law of faith.

45:003:028 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
           the deeds of the law.

45:003:029 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the
           Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

45:003:030 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
           faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

45:003:031 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
           we establish the law.

45:004:001 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
           to the flesh, hath found?

45:004:002 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
           glory; but not before God.

45:004:003 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
           counted unto him for righteousness.

45:004:004 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
           but of debt.

45:004:005 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
           justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
           righteousness.

45:004:006 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
           whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

45:004:007 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
           whose sins are covered.

45:004:008 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

45:004:009 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
           upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
           reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

45:004:010 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
           uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

45:004:011 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
           righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
           uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
           believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness
           might be imputed unto them also:

45:004:012 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
           circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that
           faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
           uncircumcised.

45:004:013 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
           not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
           the righteousness of faith.

45:004:014 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
           and the promise made of none effect:

45:004:015 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is
           no transgression.

45:004:016 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
           end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
           only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
           faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

45:004:017 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
           before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
           dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
           were.

45:004:018 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
           father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So
           shall thy seed be.

45:004:019 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
           now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet
           the deadness of Sarah's womb:

45:004:020 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
           was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

45:004:021 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
           able also to perform.

45:004:022 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

45:004:023 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
           to him;

45:004:024 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
           him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

45:004:025 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
           our justification.

45:005:001 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
           through our Lord Jesus Christ:

45:005:002 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
           we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

45:005:003 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing
           that tribulation worketh patience;

45:005:004 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

45:005:005 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
           abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

45:005:006 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
           for the ungodly.

45:005:007 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
           peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

45:005:008 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
           yet sinners, Christ died for us.

45:005:009 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
           saved from wrath through him.

45:005:010 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
           death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
           saved by his life.

45:005:011 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
           Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

45:005:012 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
           by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
           sinned:

45:005:013 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
           imputed when there is no law.

45:005:014 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
           that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
           transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

45:005:015 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
           through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace
           of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
           Christ, hath abounded unto many.

45:005:016 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
           judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of
           many offences unto justification.

45:005:017 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
           they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
           righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

45:005:018 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
           to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free
           gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

45:005:019 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
           the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

45:005:020 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
           where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

45:005:021 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
           through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
           Lord.

45:006:001 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
           may abound?

45:006:002 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
           longer therein?

45:006:003 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
           Christ were baptized into his death?

45:006:004 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
           like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
           Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

45:006:005 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
           death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

45:006:006 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
           body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not
           serve sin.

45:006:007 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

45:006:008 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
           live with him:

45:006:009 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
           death hath no more dominion over him.

45:006:010 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
           liveth, he liveth unto God.

45:006:011 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
           but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

45:006:012 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
           should obey it in the lusts thereof.

45:006:013 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
           unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as
           those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
           instruments of righteousness unto God.

45:006:014 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
           the law, but under grace.

45:006:015 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
           under grace? God forbid.

45:006:016 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
           obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
           death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

45:006:017 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
           have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
           delivered you.

45:006:018 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
           righteousness.

45:006:019 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
           your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
           uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
           your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

45:006:020 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
           righteousness.

45:006:021 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
           ashamed? for the end of those things is death.

45:006:022 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
           ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
           life.

45:006:023 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
           life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

45:007:001 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the
           law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
           liveth?

45:007:002 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her
           husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she
           is loosed from the law of her husband.

45:007:003 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to
           another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her
           husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
           adulteress, though she be married to another man.

45:007:004 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
           the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even
           to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth
           fruit unto God.

45:007:005 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were
           by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto
           death.

45:007:006 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein
           we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
           not in the oldness of the letter.

45:007:007 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
           not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,
           except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

45:007:008 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
           manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

45:007:009 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
           came, sin revived, and I died.

45:007:010 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
           unto death.

45:007:011 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and
           by it slew me.

45:007:012 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
           and good.

45:007:013 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.
           But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that
           which is good; that sin by the commandment might become
           exceeding sinful.

45:007:014 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
           under sin.

45:007:015 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I
           not; but what I hate, that do I.

45:007:016 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
           that it is good.

45:007:017 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
           me.

45:007:018 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
           thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that
           which is good I find not.

45:007:019 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
           not, that I do.

45:007:020 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but
           sin that dwelleth in me.

45:007:021 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
           with me.

45:007:022 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

45:007:023 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
           of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
           which is in my members.

45:007:024 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
           of this death?

45:007:025 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
           mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law
           of sin.

45:008:001 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
           Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
           Spirit.

45:008:002 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
           free from the law of sin and death.

45:008:003 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
           flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
           flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

45:008:004 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
           who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

45:008:005 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
           flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the
           Spirit.

45:008:006 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
           minded is life and peace.

45:008:007 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
           subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

45:008:008 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

45:008:009 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
           the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
           Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

45:008:010 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
           the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

45:008:011 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
           dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall
           also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
           you.

45:008:012 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
           after the flesh.

45:008:013 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
           through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
           live.

45:008:014 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons
           of God.

45:008:015 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
           Abba, Father.

45:008:016 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
           the children of God:

45:008:017 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
           with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
           also glorified together.

45:008:018 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
           worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
           in us.

45:008:019 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
           manifestation of the sons of God.

45:008:020 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
           but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

45:008:021 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
           bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
           children of God.

45:008:022 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
           pain together until now.

45:008:023 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the
           firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
           ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
           our body.

45:008:024 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
           for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

45:008:025 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
           wait for it.

45:008:026 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
           not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
           maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
           uttered.

45:008:027 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
           the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
           according to the will of God.

45:008:028 And we know that all things work together for good to them
           that love God, to them who are the called according to his
           purpose.

45:008:029 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
           conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the
           firstborn among many brethren.

45:008:030 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
           whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,
           them he also glorified.

45:008:031 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who
           can be against us?

45:008:032 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
           all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

45:008:033 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
           God that justifieth.

45:008:034 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
           that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
           also maketh intercession for us.

45:008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
           tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
           nakedness, or peril, or sword?

45:008:036 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
           we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

45:008:037 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
           him that loved us.

45:008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
           nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
           to come,

45:008:039 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
           to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
           our Lord.

45:009:001 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
           bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

45:009:002 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

45:009:003 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
           brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

45:009:004 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
           glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
           service of God, and the promises;

45:009:005 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh
           Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

45:009:006 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
           are not all Israel, which are of Israel:

45:009:007 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
           children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

45:009:008 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are
           not the children of God: but the children of the promise are
           counted for the seed.

45:009:009 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
           Sarah shall have a son.

45:009:010 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
           even by our father Isaac;

45:009:011 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any
           good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
           might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

45:009:012 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

45:009:013 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

45:009:014 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
           forbid.

45:009:015 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
           mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
           compassion.

45:009:016 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
           runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

45:009:017 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
           purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in
           thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
           earth.

45:009:018 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
           he will he hardeneth.

45:009:019 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For
           who hath resisted his will?

45:009:020 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
           the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
           me thus?

45:009:021 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
           make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

45:009:022 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
           known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath
           fitted to destruction:

45:009:023 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the
           vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

45:009:024 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
           of the Gentiles?

45:009:025 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which
           were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

45:009:026 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
           unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called
           the children of the living God.

45:009:027 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
           children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall
           be saved:

45:009:028 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
           righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon
           the earth.

45:009:029 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left
           us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
           Gomorrha.

45:009:030 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
           after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
           righteousness which is of faith.

45:009:031 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
           hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

45:009:032 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were
           by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
           stumblingstone;

45:009:033 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and
           rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be
           ashamed.

45:010:001 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
           that they might be saved.

45:010:002 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
           according to knowledge.

45:010:003 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
           about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
           themselves unto the righteousness of God.

45:010:004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
           one that believeth.

45:010:005 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
           That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

45:010:006 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
           Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that
           is, to bring Christ down from above:)

45:010:007 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
           Christ again from the dead.)

45:010:008 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
           and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

45:010:009 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
           shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
           dead, thou shalt be saved.

45:010:010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
           the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

45:010:011 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not
           be ashamed.

45:010:012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
           the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

45:010:013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
           saved.

45:010:014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
           believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have
           not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

45:010:015 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
           written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
           gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

45:010:016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
           Lord, who hath believed our report?

45:010:017 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
           God.

45:010:018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
           into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
           world.

45:010:019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
           provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
           foolish nation I will anger you.

45:010:020 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
           sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not
           after me.

45:010:021 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
           hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

45:011:001 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I
           also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
           Benjamin.

45:011:002 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye
           not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh
           intercession to God against Israel saying,

45:011:003 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
           altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

45:011:004 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
           myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the
           image of Baal.

45:011:005 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
           according to the election of grace.

45:011:006 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace
           is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more
           grace: otherwise work is no more work.

45:011:007 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
           but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

45:011:008 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
           slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they
           should not hear;) unto this day.

45:011:009 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
           and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

45:011:010 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow
           down their back alway.

45:011:011 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
           forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
           the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

45:011:012 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
           diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
           their fulness?

45:011:013 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of
           the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

45:011:014 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
           flesh, and might save some of them.

45:011:015 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
           world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the
           dead?

45:011:016 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if
           the root be holy, so are the branches.

45:011:017 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
           wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them
           partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

45:011:018 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
           bearest not the root, but the root thee.

45:011:019 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
           be graffed in.

45:011:020 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
           standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

45:011:021 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he
           also spare not thee.

45:011:022 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
           which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou
           continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut
           off.

45:011:023 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
           graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

45:011:024 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
           nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive
           tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural
           branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?

45:011:025 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
           mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
           blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of
           the Gentiles be come in.

45:011:026 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There
           shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
           ungodliness from Jacob:

45:011:027 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
           their sins.

45:011:028 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
           as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's
           sakes.

45:011:029 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

45:011:030 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
           obtained mercy through their unbelief:

45:011:031 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
           mercy they also may obtain mercy.

45:011:032 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might
           have mercy upon all.

45:011:033 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
           God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
           finding out!

45:011:034 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
           counsellor?

45:011:035 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
           unto him again?

45:011:036 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to
           whom be glory for ever. Amen.

45:012:001 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
           ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
           unto God, which is your reasonable service.

45:012:002 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
           the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
           good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

45:012:003 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
           is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he
           ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath
           dealt to every man the measure of faith.

45:012:004 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
           not the same office:

45:012:005 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
           members one of another.

45:012:006 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
           given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to
           the proportion of faith;

45:012:007 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that
           teacheth, on teaching;

45:012:008 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
           do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
           sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

45:012:009 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
           cleave to that which is good.

45:012:010 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
           honour preferring one another;

45:012:011 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

45:012:012 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
           in prayer;

45:012:013 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

45:012:014 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

45:012:015 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
           weep.

45:012:016 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
           but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own
           conceits.

45:012:017 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
           the sight of all men.

45:012:018 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
           with all men.

45:012:019 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
           unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will
           repay, saith the Lord.

45:012:020 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
           him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on
           his head.

45:012:021 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

45:013:001 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
           no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

45:013:002 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
           ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to
           themselves damnation.

45:013:003 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
           Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is
           good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

45:013:004 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do
           that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
           vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
           wrath upon him that doeth evil.

45:013:005 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
           also for conscience sake.

45:013:006 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
           ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

45:013:007 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
           due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
           honour.

45:013:008 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
           loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

45:013:009 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
           Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
           shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
           briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
           thy neighbour as thyself.

45:013:010 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
           fulfilling of the law.

45:013:011 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
           out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we
           believed.

45:013:012 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
           cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
           of light.

45:013:013 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
           drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife
           and envying.

45:013:014 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
           for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

45:014:001 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
           disputations.

45:014:002 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
           weak, eateth herbs.

45:014:003 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
           not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
           received him.

45:014:004 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
           master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for
           God is able to make him stand.

45:014:005 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth
           every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
           mind.

45:014:006 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
           that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.
           He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks;
           and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth
           God thanks.

45:014:007 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

45:014:008 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
           die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
           we are the Lord's.

45:014:009 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
           he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

45:014:010 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
           nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
           seat of Christ.

45:014:011 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
           bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

45:014:012 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

45:014:013 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
           this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion
           to fall in his brother's way.

45:014:014 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
           nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing
           to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

45:014:015 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
           not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
           died.

45:014:016 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

45:014:017 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
           righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

45:014:018 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
           God, and approved of men.

45:014:019 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
           and things wherewith one may edify another.

45:014:020 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
           pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

45:014:021 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
           thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
           made weak.

45:014:022 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
           that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

45:014:023 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
           not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

45:015:001 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
           weak, and not to please ourselves.

45:015:002 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
           edification.

45:015:003 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,
           The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

45:015:004 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
           our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
           scriptures might have hope.

45:015:005 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
           likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

45:015:006 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
           Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

45:015:007 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
           to the glory of God.

45:015:008 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
           for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
           fathers:

45:015:009 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
           is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
           Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

45:015:010 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

45:015:011 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
           ye people.

45:015:012 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
           he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall
           the Gentiles trust.

45:015:013 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
           believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of
           the Holy Ghost.

45:015:014 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
           also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able
           also to admonish one another.

45:015:015 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
           you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
           that is given to me of God,

45:015:016 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
           ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the
           Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
           Ghost.

45:015:017 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
           those things which pertain to God.

45:015:018 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
           Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient,
           by word and deed,

45:015:019 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit
           of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto
           Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

45:015:020 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
           was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

45:015:021 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall
           see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

45:015:022 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
           you.

45:015:023 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
           great desire these many years to come unto you;

45:015:024 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
           for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my
           way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
           your company.

45:015:025 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

45:015:026 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
           certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
           Jerusalem.

45:015:027 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
           if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
           things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal
           things.

45:015:028 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
           this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

45:015:029 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
           fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

45:015:030 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
           and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with
           me in your prayers to God for me;

45:015:031 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
           Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be
           accepted of the saints;

45:015:032 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
           with you be refreshed.

45:015:033 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

45:016:001 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
           church which is at Cenchrea:

45:016:002 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that
           ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for
           she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

45:016:003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

45:016:004 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
           only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

45:016:005 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
           well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto
           Christ.

45:016:006 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

45:016:007 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my
           fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also
           were in Christ before me.

45:016:008 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

45:016:009 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

45:016:010 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
           Aristobulus' household.

45:016:011 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the
           household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

45:016:012 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute
           the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

45:016:013 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

45:016:014 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
           brethren which are with them.

45:016:015 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
           Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

45:016:016 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
           salute you.

45:016:017 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
           and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;
           and avoid them.

45:016:018 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
           their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive
           the hearts of the simple.

45:016:019 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
           therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto
           that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

45:016:020 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
           shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

45:016:021 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
           my kinsmen, salute you.

45:016:022 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

45:016:023 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.
           Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus
           a brother.

45:016:024 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

45:016:025 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
           gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
           revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the
           world began,

45:016:026 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the
           prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,
           made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

45:016:027 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.
           Amen.
Book 46        1 Corinthians

46:001:001 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
           of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

46:001:002 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
           sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that
           in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
           both their's and our's:

46:001:003 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

46:001:004 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God
           which is given you by Jesus Christ;

46:001:005 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
           and in all knowledge;

46:001:006 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

46:001:007 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
           our Lord Jesus Christ:

46:001:008 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be
           blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

46:001:009 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of
           his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

46:001:010 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no
           divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together
           in the same mind and in the same judgment.

46:001:011 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
           which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions
           among you.

46:001:012 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and
           I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

46:001:013 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
           baptized in the name of Paul?

46:001:014 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and
           Gaius;

46:001:015 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

46:001:016 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
           know not whether I baptized any other.

46:001:017 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
           not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be
           made of none effect.

46:001:018 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
           foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of
           God.

46:001:019 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
           will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

46:001:020 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer
           of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this
           world?

46:001:021 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
           not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to
           save them that believe.

46:001:022 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

46:001:023 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
           stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

46:001:024 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
           the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

46:001:025 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
           weakness of God is stronger than men.

46:001:026 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
           after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

46:001:027 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
           confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the
           world to confound the things which are mighty;

46:001:028 And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
           hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
           nought things that are:

46:001:029 That no flesh should glory in his presence.

46:001:030 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
           wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

46:001:031 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
           glory in the Lord.

46:002:001 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
           of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of
           God.

46:002:002 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
           Christ, and him crucified.

46:002:003 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
           trembling.

46:002:004 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
           man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

46:002:005 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
           the power of God.

46:002:006 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
           the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world,
           that come to nought:

46:002:007 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
           wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

46:002:008 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
           known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

46:002:009 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
           neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which
           God hath prepared for them that love him.

46:002:010 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
           Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

46:002:011 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
           man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,
           but the Spirit of God.

46:002:012 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
           spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
           freely given to us of God.

46:002:013 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
           wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
           spiritual things with spiritual.

46:002:014 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
           God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
           them, because they are spiritually discerned.

46:002:015 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
           judged of no man.

46:002:016 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
           him? But we have the mind of Christ.

46:003:001 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
           but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

46:003:002 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
           were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

46:003:003 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying,
           and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

46:003:004 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of
           Apollos; are ye not carnal?

46:003:005 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
           believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

46:003:006 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

46:003:007 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
           watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

46:003:008 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
           man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

46:003:009 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's
           husbandry, ye are God's building.

46:003:010 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
           wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another
           buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth
           thereupon.

46:003:011 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
           is Jesus Christ.

46:003:012 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,
           precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

46:003:013 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
           declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
           shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

46:003:014 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he
           shall receive a reward.

46:003:015 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
           he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

46:003:016 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
           of God dwelleth in you?

46:003:017 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
           for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

46:003:018 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
           wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
           wise.

46:003:019 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it
           is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

46:003:020 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
           they are vain.

46:003:021 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;

46:003:022 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
           death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

46:003:023 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

46:004:001 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
           stewards of the mysteries of God.

46:004:002 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
           faithful.

46:004:003 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
           of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

46:004:004 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
           but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

46:004:005 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
           who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
           and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then
           shall every man have praise of God.

46:004:006 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
           myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in
           us not to think of men above that which is written, that no
           one of you be puffed up for one against another.

46:004:007 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
           that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why
           dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?

46:004:008 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
           without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also
           might reign with you.

46:004:009 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as
           it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
           the world, and to angels, and to men.

46:004:010 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we
           are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
           despised.

46:004:011 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
           are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
           dwellingplace;

46:004:012 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
           bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

46:004:013 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
           world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

46:004:014 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
           I warn you.

46:004:015 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet
           have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
           you through the gospel.

46:004:016 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

46:004:017 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my
           beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you
           into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach
           every where in every church.

46:004:018 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

46:004:019 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will
           know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the
           power.

46:004:020 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

46:004:021 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
           and in the spirit of meekness?

46:005:001 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
           and such fornication as is not so much as named among the
           Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

46:005:002 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he
           that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

46:005:003 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
           judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that
           hath so done this deed,

46:005:004 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
           together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
           Christ,

46:005:005 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
           flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
           Jesus.

46:005:006 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
           leaveneth the whole lump?

46:005:007 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
           as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is
           sacrificed for us:

46:005:008 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
           with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
           unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

46:005:009 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with
           fornicators:

46:005:010 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
           the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then
           must ye needs go out of the world.

46:005:011 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
           man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or
           an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
           with such an one no not to eat.

46:005:012 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do
           not ye judge them that are within?

46:005:013 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from
           among yourselves that wicked person.

46:006:001 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
           before the unjust, and not before the saints?

46:006:002 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if
           the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
           smallest matters?

46:006:003 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things
           that pertain to this life?

46:006:004 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,
           set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

46:006:005 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
           among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his
           brethren?

46:006:006 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
           unbelievers.

46:006:007 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
           go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong?
           why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

46:006:008 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

46:006:009 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom
           of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
           nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
           mankind,

46:006:010 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
           extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

46:006:011 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
           sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
           Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

46:006:012 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
           expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be
           brought under the power of any.

46:006:013 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
           destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication,
           but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

46:006:014 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up
           us by his own power.

46:006:015 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall
           I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members
           of an harlot? God forbid.

46:006:016 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
           body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

46:006:017 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

46:006:018 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the
           body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his
           own body.

46:006:019 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
           Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not
           your own?

46:006:020 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
           body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

46:007:001 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good
           for a man not to touch a woman.

46:007:002 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
           wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

46:007:003 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and
           likewise also the wife unto the husband.

46:007:004 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
           likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but
           the wife.

46:007:005 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
           time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and
           come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your
           incontinency.

46:007:006 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

46:007:007 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man
           hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and
           another after that.

46:007:008 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
           them if they abide even as I.

46:007:009 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
           to marry than to burn.

46:007:010 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let
           not the wife depart from her husband:

46:007:011 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be
           reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away
           his wife.

46:007:012 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a
           wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
           let him not put her away.

46:007:013 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if
           he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

46:007:014 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
           unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
           children unclean; but now are they holy.

46:007:015 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
           sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called
           us to peace.

46:007:016 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
           husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
           thy wife?

46:007:017 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
           called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all
           churches.

46:007:018 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
           uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
           circumcised.

46:007:019 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but
           the keeping of the commandments of God.

46:007:020 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

46:007:021 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
           mayest be made free, use it rather.

46:007:022 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the
           Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free,
           is Christ's servant.

46:007:023 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

46:007:024 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide
           with God.

46:007:025 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet
           I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the
           Lord to be faithful.

46:007:026 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
           distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.

46:007:027 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
           loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

46:007:028 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
           marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have
           trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.

46:007:029 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth,
           that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

46:007:030 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
           rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
           though they possessed not;

46:007:031 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the
           fashion of this world passeth away.

46:007:032 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
           careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
           please the Lord:

46:007:033 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
           world, how he may please his wife.

46:007:034 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
           unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she
           may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is
           married careth for the things of the world, how she may please
           her husband.

46:007:035 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a
           snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may
           attend upon the Lord without distraction.

46:007:036 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward
           his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so
           require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them
           marry.

46:007:037 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
           necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so
           decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

46:007:038 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
           giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

46:007:039 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth;
           but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to
           whom she will; only in the Lord.

46:007:040 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
           think also that I have the Spirit of God.

46:008:001 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
           have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

46:008:002 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
           nothing yet as he ought to know.

46:008:003 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

46:008:004 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
           offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is
           nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but
           one.

46:008:005 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or
           in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

46:008:006 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
           things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
           all things, and we by him.

46:008:007 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some
           with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing
           offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is
           defiled.

46:008:008 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are
           we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

46:008:009 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become
           a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

46:008:010 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
           the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is
           weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to
           idols;

46:008:011 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
           whom Christ died?

46:008:012 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
           conscience, ye sin against Christ.

46:008:013 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no
           flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to
           offend.

46:009:001 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus
           Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

46:009:002 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you:
           for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

46:009:003 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

46:009:004 Have we not power to eat and to drink?

46:009:005 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as
           other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

46:009:006 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

46:009:007 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth
           a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
           feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

46:009:008 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same
           also?

46:009:009 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle
           the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take
           care for oxen?

46:009:010 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
           doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in
           hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of
           his hope.

46:009:011 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing
           if we shall reap your carnal things?

46:009:012 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we
           rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
           all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

46:009:013 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live
           of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar
           are partakers with the altar?

46:009:014 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
           gospel should live of the gospel.

46:009:015 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
           these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were
           better for me to die, than that any man should make my
           glorying void.

46:009:016 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of:
           for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I
           preach not the gospel!

46:009:017 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if
           against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed
           unto me.

46:009:018 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel,
           I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse
           not my power in the gospel.

46:009:019 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself
           servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

46:009:020 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
           Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I
           might gain them that are under the law;

46:009:021 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not
           without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might
           gain them that are without law.

46:009:022 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
           made all things to all men, that I might by all means save
           some.

46:009:023 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker
           thereof with you.

46:009:024 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
           receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

46:009:025 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in
           all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but
           we an incorruptible.

46:009:026 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
           that beateth the air:

46:009:027 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest
           that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
           should be a castaway.

46:010:001 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
           how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
           through the sea;

46:010:002 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

46:010:003 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

46:010:004 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of
           that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
           Christ.

46:010:005 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
           overthrown in the wilderness.

46:010:006 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
           not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

46:010:007 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is
           written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
           play.

46:010:008 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
           and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

46:010:009 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
           were destroyed of serpents.

46:010:010 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
           destroyed of the destroyer.

46:010:011 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
           they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
           world are come.

46:010:012 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
           fall.

46:010:013 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
           man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
           tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation
           also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

46:010:014 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

46:010:015 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

46:010:016 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
           the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
           communion of the body of Christ?

46:010:017 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all
           partakers of that one bread.

46:010:018 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
           sacrifices partakers of the altar?

46:010:019 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is
           offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

46:010:020 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
           sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
           should have fellowship with devils.

46:010:021 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
           cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of
           devils.

46:010:022 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

46:010:023 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not
           expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify
           not.

46:010:024 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

46:010:025 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no
           question for conscience sake:

46:010:026 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

46:010:027 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
           disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no
           question for conscience sake.

46:010:028 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
           idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience
           sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

46:010:029 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is
           my liberty judged of another man's conscience?

46:010:030 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for
           that for which I give thanks?

46:010:031 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
           all to the glory of God.

46:010:032 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles,
           nor to the church of God:

46:010:033 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own
           profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

46:011:001 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

46:011:002 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
           and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

46:011:003 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is
           Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of
           Christ is God.

46:011:004 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
           dishonoureth his head.

46:011:005 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
           uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as
           if she were shaven.

46:011:006 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if
           it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
           covered.

46:011:007 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he
           is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of
           the man.

46:011:008 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

46:011:009 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
           the man.

46:011:010 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head
           because of the angels.

46:011:011 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
           woman without the man, in the Lord.

46:011:012 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
           woman; but all things of God.

46:011:013 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
           uncovered?

46:011:014 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have
           long hair, it is a shame unto him?

46:011:015 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her
           hair is given her for a covering.

46:011:016 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
           neither the churches of God.

46:011:017 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
           come together not for the better, but for the worse.

46:011:018 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
           that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

46:011:019 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
           approved may be made manifest among you.

46:011:020 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
           eat the Lord's supper.

46:011:021 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper:
           and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

46:011:022 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
           the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I
           say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

46:011:023 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
           unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
           betrayed took bread:

46:011:024 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
           eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
           remembrance of me.

46:011:025 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
           supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:
           this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

46:011:026 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
           shew the Lord's death till he come.

46:011:027 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
           of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
           of the Lord.

46:011:028 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
           bread, and drink of that cup.

46:011:029 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
           drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

46:011:030 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
           sleep.

46:011:031 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

46:011:032 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
           should not be condemned with the world.

46:011:033 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry
           one for another.

46:011:034 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
           together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order
           when I come.

46:012:001 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
           ignorant.

46:012:002 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
           idols, even as ye were led.

46:012:003 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
           the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
           say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

46:012:004 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

46:012:005 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
           Lord.

46:012:006 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
           God which worketh all in all.

46:012:007 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
           profit withal.

46:012:008 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
           another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

46:012:009 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
           healing by the same Spirit;

46:012:010 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
           another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
           tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

46:012:011 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
           dividing to every man severally as he will.

46:012:012 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
           members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
           Christ.

46:012:013 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
           we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
           been all made to drink into one Spirit.

46:012:014 For the body is not one member, but many.

46:012:015 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
           the body; is it therefore not of the body?

46:012:016 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
           of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

46:012:017 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the
           whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

46:012:018 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
           body, as it hath pleased him.

46:012:019 And if they were all one member, where were the body?

46:012:020 But now are they many members, yet but one body.

46:012:021 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
           nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

46:012:022 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
           more feeble, are necessary:

46:012:023 And those members of the body, which we think to be less
           honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our
           uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

46:012:024 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
           body together, having given more abundant honour to that part
           which lacked.

46:012:025 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the
           members should have the same care one for another.

46:012:026 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
           or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

46:012:027 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

46:012:028 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,
           secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles,
           then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of
           tongues.

46:012:029 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
           workers of miracles?

46:012:030 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do
           all interpret?

46:012:031 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a
           more excellent way.

46:013:001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
           not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
           cymbal.

46:013:002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
           mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
           that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
           nothing.

46:013:003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
           I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
           profiteth me nothing.

46:013:004 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
           charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

46:013:005 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
           easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

46:013:006 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

46:013:007 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
           endureth all things.

46:013:008 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
           shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
           whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

46:013:009 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

46:013:010 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
           part shall be done away.

46:013:011 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
           child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put
           away childish things.

46:013:012 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
           now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am
           known.

46:013:013 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
           greatest of these is charity.

46:014:001 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather
           that ye may prophesy.

46:014:002 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
           men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in
           the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

46:014:003 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
           exhortation, and comfort.

46:014:004 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
           that prophesieth edifieth the church.

46:014:005 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
           prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that
           speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church
           may receive edifying.

46:014:006 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
           shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by
           revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by
           doctrine?

46:014:007 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
           harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall
           it be known what is piped or harped?

46:014:008 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
           himself to the battle?

46:014:009 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
           understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
           speak into the air.

46:014:010 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
           and none of them is without signification.

46:014:011 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
           unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall
           be a barbarian unto me.

46:014:012 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts,
           seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

46:014:013 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
           he may interpret.

46:014:014 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
           understanding is unfruitful.

46:014:015 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
           with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and
           I will sing with the understanding also.

46:014:016 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
           occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of
           thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

46:014:017 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not
           edified.

46:014:018 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

46:014:019 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my
           understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also,
           than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

46:014:020 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice
           be ye children, but in understanding be men.

46:014:021 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
           lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will
           they not hear me, saith the Lord.

46:014:022 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,
           but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for
           them that believe not, but for them which believe.

46:014:023 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
           and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are
           unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

46:014:024 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
           or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

46:014:025 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
           falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that
           God is in you of a truth.

46:014:026 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
           you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a
           revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done
           unto edifying.

46:014:027 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
           the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

46:014:028 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
           church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

46:014:029 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

46:014:030 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
           first hold his peace.

46:014:031 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and
           all may be comforted.

46:014:032 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

46:014:033 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in
           all churches of the saints.

46:014:034 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
           permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be
           under obedience as also saith the law.

46:014:035 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands
           at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

46:014:036 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
           only?

46:014:037 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let
           him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
           commandments of the Lord.

46:014:038 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

46:014:039 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to
           speak with tongues.

46:014:040 Let all things be done decently and in order.

46:015:001 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
           preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye
           stand;

46:015:002 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
           preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

46:015:003 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
           received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
           scriptures;

46:015:004 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
           according to the scriptures:

46:015:005 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

46:015:006 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
           once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but
           some are fallen asleep.

46:015:007 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

46:015:008 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of
           due time.

46:015:009 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
           called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

46:015:010 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
           was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more
           abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
           which was with me.

46:015:011 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
           believed.

46:015:012 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
           some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

46:015:013 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
           not risen:

46:015:014 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
           your faith is also vain.

46:015:015 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
           testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not
           up, if so be that the dead rise not.

46:015:016 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

46:015:017 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in
           your sins.

46:015:018 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

46:015:019 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
           most miserable.

46:015:020 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
           firstfruits of them that slept.

46:015:021 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
           of the dead.

46:015:022 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
           alive.

46:015:023 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
           afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

46:015:024 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
           kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down
           all rule and all authority and power.

46:015:025 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
           feet.

46:015:026 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

46:015:027 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
           all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
           excepted, which did put all things under him.

46:015:028 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
           Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under
           him, that God may be all in all.

46:015:029 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
           the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the
           dead?

46:015:030 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

46:015:031 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
           Lord, I die daily.

46:015:032 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
           Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us
           eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

46:015:033 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

46:015:034 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
           knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

46:015:035 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
           what body do they come?

46:015:036 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
           die:

46:015:037 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
           shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some
           other grain:

46:015:038 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
           seed his own body.

46:015:039 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of
           flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and
           another of birds.

46:015:040 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
           the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
           terrestrial is another.

46:015:041 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
           and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from
           another star in glory.

46:015:042 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
           corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

46:015:043 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in
           weakness; it is raised in power:

46:015:044 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
           There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

46:015:045 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
           soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

46:015:046 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which
           is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

46:015:047 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
           Lord from heaven.

46:015:048 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as
           is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

46:015:049 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
           bear the image of the heavenly.

46:015:050 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
           the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
           incorruption.

46:015:051 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
           shall all be changed,

46:015:052 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
           for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
           incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

46:015:053 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
           must put on immortality.

46:015:054 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
           this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
           brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
           up in victory.

46:015:055 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

46:015:056 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

46:015:057 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
           Lord Jesus Christ.

46:015:058 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
           always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know
           that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

46:016:001 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
           order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

46:016:002 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him
           in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
           gatherings when I come.

46:016:003 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
           them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

46:016:004 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

46:016:005 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
           for I do pass through Macedonia.

46:016:006 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you,
           that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

46:016:007 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
           while with you, if the Lord permit.

46:016:008 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

46:016:009 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there
           are many adversaries.

46:016:010 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without
           fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

46:016:011 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
           peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the
           brethren.

46:016:012 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
           unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to
           come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
           convenient time.

46:016:013 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be
           strong.

46:016:014 Let all your things be done with charity.

46:016:015 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
           it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted
           themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

46:016:016 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that
           helpeth with us, and laboureth.

46:016:017 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
           Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have
           supplied.

46:016:018 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore
           acknowledge ye them that are such.

46:016:019 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute
           you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

46:016:020 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy
           kiss.

46:016:021 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

46:016:022 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
           Maranatha.

46:016:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

46:016:024 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Book 47        2 Corinthians

47:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
           Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at
           Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:

47:001:002 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

47:001:003 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
           Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

47:001:004 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
           to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
           wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

47:001:005 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
           consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

47:001:006 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
           salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
           sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted,
           it is for your consolation and salvation.

47:001:007 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
           partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
           consolation.

47:001:008 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
           which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,
           above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

47:001:009 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
           not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

47:001:010 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
           whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

47:001:011 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
           bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
           given by many on our behalf.

47:001:012 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
           that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
           wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
           in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

47:001:013 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
           acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

47:001:014 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
           rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord
           Jesus.

47:001:015 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
           that ye might have a second benefit;

47:001:016 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
           Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward
           Judaea.

47:001:017 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
           things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
           that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

47:001:018 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

47:001:019 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
           by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and
           nay, but in him was yea.

47:001:020 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,
           unto the glory of God by us.

47:001:021 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
           anointed us, is God;

47:001:022 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
           in our hearts.

47:001:023 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
           you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

47:001:024 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
           of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

47:002:001 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again
           to you in heaviness.

47:002:002 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad,
           but the same which is made sorry by me?

47:002:003 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should
           have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
           confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

47:002:004 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
           you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that
           ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

47:002:005 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
           part: that I may not overcharge you all.

47:002:006 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was
           inflicted of many.

47:002:007 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
           comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up
           with overmuch sorrow.

47:002:008 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
           him.

47:002:009 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof
           of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

47:002:010 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
           any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it
           in the person of Christ;

47:002:011 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not
           ignorant of his devices.

47:002:012 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel,
           and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

47:002:013 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my
           brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into
           Macedonia.

47:002:014 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
           Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us
           in every place.

47:002:015 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
           saved, and in them that perish:

47:002:016 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the
           other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for
           these things?

47:002:017 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as
           of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
           Christ.

47:003:001 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
           others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of
           commendation from you?

47:003:002 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
           all men:

47:003:003 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
           Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
           Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
           fleshy tables of the heart.

47:003:004 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

47:003:005 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as
           of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

47:003:006 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
           of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but
           the spirit giveth life.

47:003:007 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
           stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not
           stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his
           countenance; which glory was to be done away:

47:003:008 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
           glorious?

47:003:009 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
           doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

47:003:010 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
           respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

47:003:011 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
           which remaineth is glorious.

47:003:012 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
           speech:

47:003:013 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the
           children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of
           that which is abolished:

47:003:014 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the
           same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
           which vail is done away in Christ.

47:003:015 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
           their heart.

47:003:016 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
           taken away.

47:003:017 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
           is, there is liberty.

47:003:018 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
           of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
           glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

47:004:001 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
           mercy, we faint not;

47:004:002 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
           walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
           deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending
           ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

47:004:003 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

47:004:004 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
           which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
           Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

47:004:005 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
           ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

47:004:006 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
           hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
           of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

47:004:007 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
           excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

47:004:008 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
           perplexed, but not in despair;

47:004:009 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

47:004:010 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
           that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
           body.

47:004:011 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus'
           sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in
           our mortal flesh.

47:004:012 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

47:004:013 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
           written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also
           believe, and therefore speak;

47:004:014 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up
           us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

47:004:015 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace
           might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of
           God.

47:004:016 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
           perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

47:004:017 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
           for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

47:004:018 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
           things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
           temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

47:005:001 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
           dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
           hands, eternal in the heavens.

47:005:002 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
           with our house which is from heaven:

47:005:003 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

47:005:004 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
           not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
           mortality might be swallowed up of life.

47:005:005 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
           also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

47:005:006 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
           at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

47:005:007 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

47:005:008 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
           the body, and to be present with the Lord.

47:005:009 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
           be accepted of him.

47:005:010 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
           that every one may receive the things done in his body,
           according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

47:005:011 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but
           we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
           manifest in your consciences.

47:005:012 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
           occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to
           answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

47:005:013 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether
           we be sober, it is for your cause.

47:005:014 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
           that if one died for all, then were all dead:

47:005:015 And that he died for all, that they which live should not
           henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
           them, and rose again.

47:005:016 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
           though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
           henceforth know we him no more.

47:005:017 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
           things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

47:005:018 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself
           by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
           reconciliation;

47:005:019 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
           himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
           committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

47:005:020 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
           beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
           reconciled to God.

47:005:021 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
           we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

47:006:001 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that
           ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

47:006:002 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
           the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the
           accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)

47:006:003 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not
           blamed:

47:006:004 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
           in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
           distresses,

47:006:005 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
           watchings, in fastings;

47:006:006 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
           the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

47:006:007 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
           righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

47:006:008 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
           deceivers, and yet true;

47:006:009 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we
           live; as chastened, and not killed;

47:006:010 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
           rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

47:006:011 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
           enlarged.

47:006:012 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
           bowels.

47:006:013 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my
           children,) be ye also enlarged.

47:006:014 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
           fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
           communion hath light with darkness?

47:006:015 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he
           that believeth with an infidel?

47:006:016 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye
           are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will
           dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
           they shall be my people.

47:006:017 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith
           the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive
           you.

47:006:018 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
           daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

47:007:001 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
           cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
           perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

47:007:002 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
           we have defrauded no man.

47:007:003 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that
           ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.

47:007:004 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my
           glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
           joyful in all our tribulation.

47:007:005 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
           but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings,
           within were fears.

47:007:006 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
           comforted us by the coming of Titus;

47:007:007 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
           he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire,
           your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced
           the more.

47:007:008 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
           though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath
           made you sorry, though it were but for a season.

47:007:009 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
           sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly
           manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.

47:007:010 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
           repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

47:007:011 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
           sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing
           of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
           what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In
           all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this
           matter.

47:007:012 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
           that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered
           wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might
           appear unto you.

47:007:013 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and
           exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because
           his spirit was refreshed by you all.

47:007:014 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not
           ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so
           our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.

47:007:015 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst
           he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
           trembling ye received him.

47:007:016 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
           things.

47:008:001 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God
           bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

47:008:002 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their
           joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
           liberality.

47:008:003 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
           they were willing of themselves;

47:008:004 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift,
           and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the
           saints.

47:008:005 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
           selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

47:008:006 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he
           would also finish in you the same grace also.

47:008:007 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
           utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
           love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

47:008:008 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness
           of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

47:008:009 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
           he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
           through his poverty might be rich.

47:008:010 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you,
           who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
           a year ago.

47:008:011 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
           readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of
           that which ye have.

47:008:012 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
           to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

47:008:013 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

47:008:014 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may
           be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a
           supply for your want: that there may be equality:

47:008:015 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over;
           and he that had gathered little had no lack.

47:008:016 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
           heart of Titus for you.

47:008:017 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more
           forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

47:008:018 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
           gospel throughout all the churches;

47:008:019 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to
           travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to
           the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready
           mind:

47:008:020 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
           which is administered by us:

47:008:021 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
           Lord, but also in the sight of men.

47:008:022 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have
           oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more
           diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.

47:008:023 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
           fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of,
           they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of
           Christ.

47:008:024 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof
           of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

47:009:001 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
           superfluous for me to write to you:

47:009:002 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of
           you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago;
           and your zeal hath provoked very many.

47:009:003 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should
           be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

47:009:004 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
           unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
           same confident boasting.

47:009:005 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
           they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your
           bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be
           ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.

47:009:006 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
           sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
           bountifully.

47:009:007 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him
           give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
           cheerful giver.

47:009:008 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
           always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
           every good work:

47:009:009 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to
           the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

47:009:010 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread
           for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the
           fruits of your righteousness;)

47:009:011 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which
           causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

47:009:012 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
           want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings
           unto God;

47:009:013 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God
           for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and
           for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

47:009:014 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
           exceeding grace of God in you.

47:009:015 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

47:010:001 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
           of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent
           am bold toward you:

47:010:002 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present
           with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
           some, which think of us as if we walked according to the
           flesh.

47:010:003 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the
           flesh:

47:010:004 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
           through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

47:010:005 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
           itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
           captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

47:010:006 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
           your obedience is fulfilled.

47:010:007 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
           trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think
           this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

47:010:008 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority,
           which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your
           destruction, I should not be ashamed:

47:010:009 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

47:010:010 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
           bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

47:010:011 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
           letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when
           we are present.

47:010:012 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
           ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
           measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
           among themselves, are not wise.

47:010:013 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
           according to the measure of the rule which God hath
           distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

47:010:014 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
           reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
           preaching the gospel of Christ:

47:010:015 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other
           men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased,
           that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
           abundantly,

47:010:016 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to
           boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

47:010:017 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

47:010:018 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
           Lord commendeth.

47:011:001 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
           indeed bear with me.

47:011:002 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
           espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a
           chaste virgin to Christ.

47:011:003 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
           through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from
           the simplicity that is in Christ.

47:011:004 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have
           not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have
           not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted,
           ye might well bear with him.

47:011:005 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest
           apostles.

47:011:006 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we
           have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

47:011:007 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
           exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God
           freely?

47:011:008 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you
           service.

47:011:009 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable
           to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which
           came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept
           myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep
           myself.

47:011:010 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
           boasting in the regions of Achaia.

47:011:011 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

47:011:012 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
           from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they
           may be found even as we.

47:011:013 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
           themselves into the apostles of Christ.

47:011:014 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel
           of light.

47:011:015 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
           transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall
           be according to their works.

47:011:016 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as
           a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

47:011:017 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
           were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

47:011:018 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

47:011:019 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

47:011:020 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man
           devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a
           man smite you on the face.

47:011:021 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
           Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am
           bold also.

47:011:022 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
           they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

47:011:023 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more;
           in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons
           more frequent, in deaths oft.

47:011:024 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

47:011:025 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
           suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

47:011:026 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of
           robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the
           heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
           in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

47:011:027 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
           and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

47:011:028 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
           me daily, the care of all the churches.

47:011:029 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
           not?

47:011:030 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which
           concern mine infirmities.

47:011:031 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
           for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

47:011:032 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city
           of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

47:011:033 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall,
           and escaped his hands.

47:012:001 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
           visions and revelations of the Lord.

47:012:002 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
           the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
           tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

47:012:003 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
           body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)

47:012:004 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
           words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

47:012:005 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
           but in mine infirmities.

47:012:006 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for
           I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
           think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he
           heareth of me.

47:012:007 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
           abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in
           the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should
           be exalted above measure.

47:012:008 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
           depart from me.

47:012:009 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
           strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore
           will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of
           Christ may rest upon me.

47:012:010 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
           necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:
           for when I am weak, then am I strong.

47:012:011 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
           ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I
           behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

47:012:012 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
           patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

47:012:013 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
           except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive
           me this wrong.

47:012:014 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will
           not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for
           the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the
           parents for the children.

47:012:015 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
           more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

47:012:016 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being
           crafty, I caught you with guile.

47:012:017 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

47:012:018 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make
           a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not
           in the same steps?

47:012:019 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak
           before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved,
           for your edifying.

47:012:020 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
           would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would
           not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
           backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:

47:012:021 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you,
           and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and
           have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
           lasciviousness which they have committed.

47:013:001 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two
           or three witnesses shall every word be established.

47:013:002 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
           second time; and being absent now I write to them which
           heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come
           again, I will not spare:

47:013:003 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
           you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

47:013:004 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
           the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
           live with him by the power of God toward you.

47:013:005 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
           selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is
           in you, except ye be reprobates?

47:013:006 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

47:013:007 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should
           appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,
           though we be as reprobates.

47:013:008 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

47:013:009 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
           also we wish, even your perfection.

47:013:010 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being
           present I should use sharpness, according to the power which
           the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.

47:013:011 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
           be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace
           shall be with you.

47:013:012 Greet one another with an holy kiss.

47:013:013 All the saints salute you.

47:013:014 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
           the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
Book 48        Galatians

48:001:001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
           Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

48:001:002 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
           Galatia:

48:001:003 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
           Lord Jesus Christ,

48:001:004 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
           this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
           Father:

48:001:005 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

48:001:006 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
           into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

48:001:007 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
           would pervert the gospel of Christ.

48:001:008 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
           gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
           him be accursed.

48:001:009 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any
           other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
           accursed.

48:001:010 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
           for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
           Christ.

48:001:011 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
           preached of me is not after man.

48:001:012 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but
           by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

48:001:013 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
           religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
           God, and wasted it:

48:001:014 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
           mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
           traditions of my fathers.

48:001:015 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
           womb, and called me by his grace,

48:001:016 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
           heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

48:001:017 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
           before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
           Damascus.

48:001:018 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
           and abode with him fifteen days.

48:001:019 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
           brother.

48:001:020 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I
           lie not.

48:001:021 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

48:001:022 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were
           in Christ:

48:001:023 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
           past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

48:001:024 And they glorified God in me.

48:002:001 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
           Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

48:002:002 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
           gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to
           them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run,
           or had run, in vain.

48:002:003 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
           compelled to be circumcised:

48:002:004 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
           came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
           Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

48:002:005 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that
           the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

48:002:006 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
           it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for
           they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to
           me:

48:002:007 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
           uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
           circumcision was unto Peter;

48:002:008 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
           of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
           Gentiles:)

48:002:009 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
           perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me
           and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go
           unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

48:002:010 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
           which I also was forward to do.

48:002:011 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
           face, because he was to be blamed.

48:002:012 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
           Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
           himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.

48:002:013 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
           Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

48:002:014 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
           truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If
           thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
           not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live
           as do the Jews?

48:002:015 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

48:002:016 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
           but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
           Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
           Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of
           the law shall no flesh be justified.

48:002:017 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
           also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of
           sin? God forbid.

48:002:018 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
           myself a transgressor.

48:002:019 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
           unto God.

48:002:020 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
           Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
           flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
           gave himself for me.

48:002:021 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come
           by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

48:003:001 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
           not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
           evidently set forth, crucified among you?

48:003:002 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
           works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

48:003:003 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
           perfect by the flesh?

48:003:004 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

48:003:005 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
           miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by
           the hearing of faith?

48:003:006 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
           righteousness.

48:003:007 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
           the children of Abraham.

48:003:008 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
           heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto
           Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

48:003:009 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
           Abraham.

48:003:010 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
           curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth
           not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
           do them.

48:003:011 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
           it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

48:003:012 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
           shall live in them.

48:003:013 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
           a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
           hangeth on a tree:

48:003:014 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
           through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
           Spirit through faith.

48:003:015 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
           man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth,
           or addeth thereto.

48:003:016 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
           not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
           which is Christ.

48:003:017 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
           of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
           years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
           of none effect.

48:003:018 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
           promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

48:003:019 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
           transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise
           was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
           mediator.

48:003:020 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

48:003:021 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
           if there had been a law given which could have given life,
           verily righteousness should have been by the law.

48:003:022 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
           promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
           believe.

48:003:023 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
           unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

48:003:024 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
           Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

48:003:025 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
           schoolmaster.

48:003:026 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

48:003:027 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
           on Christ.

48:003:028 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
           free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
           Christ Jesus.

48:003:029 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
           according to the promise.

48:004:001 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
           nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

48:004:002 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
           the father.

48:004:003 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
           elements of the world:

48:004:004 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
           Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

48:004:005 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
           the adoption of sons.

48:004:006 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
           Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

48:004:007 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
           then an heir of God through Christ.

48:004:008 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them
           which by nature are no gods.

48:004:009 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of
           God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements,
           whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

48:004:010 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

48:004:011 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
           vain.

48:004:012 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye
           have not injured me at all.

48:004:013 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
           gospel unto you at the first.

48:004:014 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
           rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
           Jesus.

48:004:015 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
           record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked
           out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

48:004:016 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
           truth?

48:004:017 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would
           exclude you, that ye might affect them.

48:004:018 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good
           thing, and not only when I am present with you.

48:004:019 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
           Christ be formed in you,

48:004:020 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice;
           for I stand in doubt of you.

48:004:021 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
           the law?

48:004:022 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
           bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

48:004:023 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but
           he of the freewoman was by promise.

48:004:024 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
           the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
           which is Agar.

48:004:025 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
           Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

48:004:026 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
           us all.

48:004:027 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
           break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the
           desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
           husband.

48:004:028 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

48:004:029 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
           that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

48:004:030 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
           and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
           with the son of the freewoman.

48:004:031 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
           of the free.

48:005:001 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
           us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

48:005:002 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
           shall profit you nothing.

48:005:003 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
           is a debtor to do the whole law.

48:005:004 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
           justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

48:005:005 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
           by faith.

48:005:006 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
           nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

48:005:007 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
           the truth?

48:005:008 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

48:005:009 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

48:005:010 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
           none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
           his judgment, whosoever he be.

48:005:011 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
           suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

48:005:012 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

48:005:013 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
           liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
           another.

48:005:014 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
           shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

48:005:015 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be
           not consumed one of another.

48:005:016 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
           the lust of the flesh.

48:005:017 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
           against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
           other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

48:005:018 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

48:005:019 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
           Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

48:005:020 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
           strife, seditions, heresies,

48:005:021 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
           the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
           past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
           kingdom of God.

48:005:022 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
           longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

48:005:023 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

48:005:024 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
           affections and lusts.

48:005:025 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

48:005:026 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
           envying one another.

48:006:001 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
           spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
           considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

48:006:002 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
           Christ.

48:006:003 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is
           nothing, he deceiveth himself.

48:006:004 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
           rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

48:006:005 For every man shall bear his own burden.

48:006:006 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
           teacheth in all good things.

48:006:007 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
           soweth, that shall he also reap.

48:006:008 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
           corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the
           Spirit reap life everlasting.

48:006:009 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
           shall reap, if we faint not.

48:006:010 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
           especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

48:006:011 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
           own hand.

48:006:012 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
           constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
           persecution for the cross of Christ.

48:006:013 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;
           but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in
           your flesh.

48:006:014 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
           Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and
           I unto the world.

48:006:015 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
           nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

48:006:016 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
           and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

48:006:017 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
           the marks of the Lord Jesus.

48:006:018 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
           spirit. Amen.
Book 49        Ephesians

49:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
           saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
           Jesus:

49:001:002 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

49:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
           hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
           places in Christ:

49:001:004 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
           the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
           in love:

49:001:005 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

49:001:006 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
           us accepted in the beloved.

49:001:007 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
           of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

49:001:008 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

49:001:009 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
           to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

49:001:010 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
           gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
           heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

49:001:011 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
           predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
           things after the counsel of his own will:

49:001:012 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
           trusted in Christ.

49:001:013 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
           truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
           ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

49:001:014 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
           of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

49:001:015 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
           Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

49:001:016 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
           prayers;

49:001:017 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
           may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
           knowledge of him:

49:001:018 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
           know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
           the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

49:001:019 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
           who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

49:001:020 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
           and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

49:001:021 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
           dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
           world, but also in that which is to come:

49:001:022 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
           head over all things to the church,

49:001:023 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

49:002:001 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
           sins;

49:002:002 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
           spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

49:002:003 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
           the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
           and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath,
           even as others.

49:002:004 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
           loved us,

49:002:005 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
           with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

49:002:006 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
           heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

49:002:007 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
           his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

49:002:008 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
           yourselves: it is the gift of God:

49:002:009 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

49:002:010 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
           works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
           them.

49:002:011 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
           flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
           the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

49:002:012 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
           the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
           of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

49:002:013 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made
           nigh by the blood of Christ.

49:002:014 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
           down the middle wall of partition between us;

49:002:015 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
           commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
           of twain one new man, so making peace;

49:002:016 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
           cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

49:002:017 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
           them that were nigh.

49:002:018 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
           Father.

49:002:019 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
           fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

49:002:020 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
           prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

49:002:021 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
           holy temple in the Lord:

49:002:022 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
           through the Spirit.

49:003:001 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
           Gentiles,

49:003:002 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which
           is given me to you-ward:

49:003:003 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
           I wrote afore in few words,

49:003:004 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
           mystery of Christ)

49:003:005 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
           as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by
           the Spirit;

49:003:006 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,
           and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

49:003:007 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
           grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his
           power.

49:003:008 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
           grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
           unsearchable riches of Christ;

49:003:009 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
           which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
           who created all things by Jesus Christ:

49:003:010 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
           heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
           wisdom of God,

49:003:011 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
           Jesus our Lord:

49:003:012 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
           faith of him.

49:003:013 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for
           you, which is your glory.

49:003:014 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
           Jesus Christ,

49:003:015 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

49:003:016 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
           to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

49:003:017 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
           rooted and grounded in love,

49:003:018 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,
           and length, and depth, and height;

49:003:019 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
           ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

49:003:020 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
           that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
           us,

49:003:021 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
           ages, world without end. Amen.

49:004:001 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
           walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

49:004:002 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
           forbearing one another in love;

49:004:003 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
           peace.

49:004:004 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
           one hope of your calling;

49:004:005 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

49:004:006 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
           and in you all.

49:004:007 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the
           measure of the gift of Christ.

49:004:008 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
           captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

49:004:009 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
           first into the lower parts of the earth?

49:004:010 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
           all heavens, that he might fill all things.)

49:004:011 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
           evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

49:004:012 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
           ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

49:004:013 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
           knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
           measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

49:004:014 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
           carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
           men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
           deceive;

49:004:015 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
           things, which is the head, even Christ:

49:004:016 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
           by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
           effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
           increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

49:004:017 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
           henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
           their mind,

49:004:018 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
           life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of
           the blindness of their heart:

49:004:019 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
           lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

49:004:020 But ye have not so learned Christ;

49:004:021 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
           as the truth is in Jesus:

49:004:022 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
           man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

49:004:023 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

49:004:024 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
           righteousness and true holiness.

49:004:025 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
           neighbour: for we are members one of another.

49:004:026 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
           wrath:

49:004:027 Neither give place to the devil.

49:004:028 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
           working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may
           have to give to him that needeth.

49:004:029 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
           that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
           minister grace unto the hearers.

49:004:030 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
           unto the day of redemption.

49:004:031 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
           evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

49:004:032 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
           another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

49:005:001 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

49:005:002 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
           himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
           sweetsmelling savour.

49:005:003 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
           not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

49:005:004 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
           are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

49:005:005 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
           covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
           kingdom of Christ and of God.

49:005:006 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
           things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
           disobedience.

49:005:007 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

49:005:008 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
           Lord: walk as children of light:

49:005:009 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
           righteousness and truth;)

49:005:010 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

49:005:011 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
           but rather reprove them.

49:005:012 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
           of them in secret.

49:005:013 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
           light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

49:005:014 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
           the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

49:005:015 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
           wise,

49:005:016 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

49:005:017 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
           the Lord is.

49:005:018 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
           with the Spirit;

49:005:019 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
           songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

49:005:020 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
           the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

49:005:021 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

49:005:022 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
           Lord.

49:005:023 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
           head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

49:005:024 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
           wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

49:005:025 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
           church, and gave himself for it;

49:005:026 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
           water by the word,

49:005:027 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
           having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
           be holy and without blemish.

49:005:028 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
           loveth his wife loveth himself.

49:005:029 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
           cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

49:005:030 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
           bones.

49:005:031 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
           shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
           flesh.

49:005:032 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
           church.

49:005:033 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
           wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her
           husband.

49:006:001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

49:006:002 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment
           with promise;

49:006:003 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
           the earth.

49:006:004 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
           them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

49:006:005 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
           to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
           heart, as unto Christ;

49:006:006 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
           Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

49:006:007 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

49:006:008 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same
           shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

49:006:009 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
           threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
           neither is there respect of persons with him.

49:006:010 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
           of his might.

49:006:011 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
           against the wiles of the devil.

49:006:012 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
           principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
           darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
           places.

49:006:013 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
           be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
           stand.

49:006:014 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
           having on the breastplate of righteousness;

49:006:015 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
           peace;

49:006:016 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
           able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

49:006:017 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
           which is the word of God:

49:006:018 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
           and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
           for all saints;

49:006:019 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
           open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

49:006:020 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may
           speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

49:006:021 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
           a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
           make known to you all things:

49:006:022 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might
           know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

49:006:023 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
           Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

49:006:024 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
           sincerity. Amen.
Book 50        Philippians

50:001:001 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
           saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops
           and deacons:

50:001:002 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

50:001:003 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

50:001:004 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
           joy,

50:001:005 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
           now;

50:001:006 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a
           good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
           Christ:

50:001:007 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I
           have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
           defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers
           of my grace.

50:001:008 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
           bowels of Jesus Christ.

50:001:009 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
           in knowledge and in all judgment;

50:001:010 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
           sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.

50:001:011 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
           Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

50:001:012 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
           which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
           furtherance of the gospel;

50:001:013 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and
           in all other places;

50:001:014 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my
           bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

50:001:015 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
           also of good will:

50:001:016 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
           to add affliction to my bonds:

50:001:017 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
           of the gospel.

50:001:018 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or
           in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
           and will rejoice.

50:001:019 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
           prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

50:001:020 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in
           nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
           always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body,
           whether it be by life, or by death.

50:001:021 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

50:001:022 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:
           yet what I shall choose I wot not.

50:001:023 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
           and to be with Christ; which is far better:

50:001:024 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

50:001:025 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
           continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

50:001:026 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for
           me by my coming to you again.

50:001:027 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
           Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
           may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,
           with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

50:001:028 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them
           an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
           that of God.

50:001:029 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
           believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

50:001:030 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to
           be in me.

50:002:001 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
           comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
           bowels and mercies,

50:002:002 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
           being of one accord, of one mind.

50:002:003 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
           lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than
           themselves.

50:002:004 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
           the things of others.

50:002:005 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

50:002:006 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
           equal with God:

50:002:007 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
           of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

50:002:008 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
           became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

50:002:009 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
           name which is above every name:

50:002:010 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
           heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

50:002:011 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
           Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

50:002:012 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
           presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
           own salvation with fear and trembling.

50:002:013 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
           his good pleasure.

50:002:014 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

50:002:015 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
           without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
           among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

50:002:016 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day
           of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
           vain.

50:002:017 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
           your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

50:002:018 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

50:002:019 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
           you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your
           state.

50:002:020 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
           state.

50:002:021 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
           Christ's.

50:002:022 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father,
           he hath served with me in the gospel.

50:002:023 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
           how it will go with me.

50:002:024 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

50:002:025 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
           brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
           messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

50:002:026 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness,
           because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

50:002:027 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
           him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have
           sorrow upon sorrow.

50:002:028 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
           again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

50:002:029 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
           such in reputation:

50:002:030 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
           regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

50:003:001 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
           things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is
           safe.

50:003:002 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
           concision.

50:003:003 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
           and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
           flesh.

50:003:004 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other
           man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,
           I more:

50:003:005 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the
           tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the
           law, a Pharisee;

50:003:006 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
           righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

50:003:007 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
           Christ.

50:003:008 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
           excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
           I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
           dung, that I may win Christ,

50:003:009 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
           is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
           the righteousness which is of God by faith:

50:003:010 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
           the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto
           his death;

50:003:011 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
           dead.

50:003:012 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
           perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
           which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

50:003:013 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
           thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
           reaching forth unto those things which are before,

50:003:014 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
           God in Christ Jesus.

50:003:015 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
           if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
           this unto you.

50:003:016 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
           the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

50:003:017 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
           walk so as ye have us for an ensample.

50:003:018 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
           you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
           Christ:

50:003:019 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
           glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

50:003:020 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
           for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

50:003:021 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
           unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
           able even to subdue all things unto himself.

50:004:001 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
           and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

50:004:002 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the
           same mind in the Lord.

50:004:003 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women
           which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and
           with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of
           life.

50:004:004 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

50:004:005 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at
           hand.

50:004:006 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
           supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
           unto God.

50:004:007 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
           keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

50:004:008 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
           things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
           things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
           things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
           there be any praise, think on these things.

50:004:009 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
           heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
           you.

50:004:010 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
           care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also
           careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

50:004:011 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
           whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

50:004:012 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
           where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
           be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

50:004:013 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

50:004:014 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
           with my affliction.

50:004:015 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
           gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
           with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

50:004:016 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
           necessity.

50:004:017 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may
           abound to your account.

50:004:018 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
           Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of
           a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

50:004:019 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches
           in glory by Christ Jesus.

50:004:020 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

50:004:021 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are
           with me greet you.

50:004:022 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
           household.

50:004:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Book 51        Colossians

51:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
           Timotheus our brother,

51:001:002 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at
           Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

51:001:003 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
           praying always for you,

51:001:004 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
           which ye have to all the saints,

51:001:005 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
           heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

51:001:006 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and
           bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye
           heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

51:001:007 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is
           for you a faithful minister of Christ;

51:001:008 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

51:001:009 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not
           cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled
           with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
           understanding;

51:001:010 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
           fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge
           of God;

51:001:011 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
           unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

51:001:012 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
           partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

51:001:013 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
           translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

51:001:014 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
           forgiveness of sins:

51:001:015 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
           creature:

51:001:016 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
           that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
           thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
           things were created by him, and for him:

51:001:017 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

51:001:018 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
           beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
           might have the preeminence.

51:001:019 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness
           dwell;

51:001:020 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him
           to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether
           they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

51:001:021 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind
           by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

51:001:022 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy
           and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

51:001:023 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
           moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
           and which was preached to every creature which is under
           heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

51:001:024 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
           which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
           his body's sake, which is the church:

51:001:025 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of
           God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

51:001:026 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
           generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

51:001:027 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
           of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
           the hope of glory:

51:001:028 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in
           all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ
           Jesus:

51:001:029 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working,
           which worketh in me mightily.

51:002:001 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
           and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my
           face in the flesh;

51:002:002 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
           love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of
           understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God,
           and of the Father, and of Christ;

51:002:003 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

51:002:004 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
           words.

51:002:005 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
           spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness
           of your faith in Christ.

51:002:006 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
           ye in him:

51:002:007 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye
           have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

51:002:008 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
           deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
           world, and not after Christ.

51:002:009 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

51:002:010 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all
           principality and power:

51:002:011 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
           without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the
           flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

51:002:012 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
           through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him
           from the dead.

51:002:013 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
           your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having
           forgiven you all trespasses;

51:002:014 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
           us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
           nailing it to his cross;

51:002:015 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
           of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

51:002:016 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
           respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
           days:

51:002:017 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
           Christ.

51:002:018 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility
           and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which
           he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

51:002:019 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints
           and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together,
           increaseth with the increase of God.

51:002:020 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
           world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
           ordinances,

51:002:021 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

51:002:022 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the
           commandments and doctrines of men?

51:002:023 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
           humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the
           satisfying of the flesh.

51:003:001 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
           above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

51:003:002 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
           earth.

51:003:003 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

51:003:004 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
           appear with him in glory.

51:003:005 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
           fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
           concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

51:003:006 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
           of disobedience:

51:003:007 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

51:003:008 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
           blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

51:003:009 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
           man with his deeds;

51:003:010 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
           after the image of him that created him:

51:003:011 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
           uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ
           is all, and in all.

51:003:012 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
           bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
           longsuffering;

51:003:013 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
           have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so
           also do ye.

51:003:014 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond
           of perfectness.

51:003:015 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
           also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

51:003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
           teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
           spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
           Lord.

51:003:017 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
           the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

51:003:018 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit
           in the Lord.

51:003:019 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

51:003:020 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well
           pleasing unto the Lord.

51:003:021 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
           discouraged.

51:003:022 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the
           flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness
           of heart, fearing God;

51:003:023 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
           unto men;

51:003:024 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
           inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

51:003:025 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he
           hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

51:004:001 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal;
           knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

51:004:002 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

51:004:003 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door
           of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
           also in bonds:

51:004:004 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

51:004:005 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the
           time.

51:004:006 Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that
           ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

51:004:007 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
           brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the
           Lord:

51:004:008 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might
           know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

51:004:009 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of
           you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done
           here.

51:004:010 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus,
           sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received
           commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

51:004:011 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the
           circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom
           of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

51:004:012 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth
           you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye
           may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

51:004:013 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and
           them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

51:004:014 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

51:004:015 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and
           the church which is in his house.

51:004:016 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read
           also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise
           read the epistle from Laodicea.

51:004:017 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou
           hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

51:004:018 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.
           Grace be with you. Amen.
Book 52        1 Thessalonians

52:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
           Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus
           Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
           the Lord Jesus Christ.

52:001:002 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
           you in our prayers;

52:001:003 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
           love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
           sight of God and our Father;

52:001:004 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

52:001:005 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
           power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye
           know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

52:001:006 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
           received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
           Ghost.

52:001:007 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
           Achaia.

52:001:008 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
           Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to
           God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any
           thing.

52:001:009 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we
           had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
           living and true God;

52:001:010 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
           dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

52:002:001 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
           it was not in vain:

52:002:002 But even after that we had suffered before, and were
           shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
           our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much
           contention.

52:002:003 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor
           in guile:

52:002:004 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
           gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which
           trieth our hearts.

52:002:005 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
           nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

52:002:006 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
           when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

52:002:007 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
           children:

52:002:008 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
           have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
           our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

52:002:009 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for
           labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable
           unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

52:002:010 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
           unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

52:002:011 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
           of you, as a father doth his children,

52:002:012 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
           kingdom and glory.

52:002:013 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
           when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye
           received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the
           word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
           believe.

52:002:014 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
           which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
           like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the
           Jews:

52:002:015 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
           have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary
           to all men:

52:002:016 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
           saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon
           them to the uttermost.

52:002:017 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
           presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see
           your face with great desire.

52:002:018 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
           again; but Satan hindered us.

52:002:019 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
           even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
           coming?

52:002:020 For ye are our glory and joy.

52:003:001 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
           to be left at Athens alone;

52:003:002 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
           fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
           to comfort you concerning your faith:

52:003:003 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for
           yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

52:003:004 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
           should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye
           know.

52:003:005 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
           your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,
           and our labour be in vain.

52:003:006 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
           good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
           remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
           also to see you:

52:003:007 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
           affliction and distress by your faith:

52:003:008 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

52:003:009 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
           the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

52:003:010 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
           and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

52:003:011 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
           direct our way unto you.

52:003:012 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
           toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

52:003:013 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
           before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ with all his saints.

52:004:001 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
           the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
           walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

52:004:002 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

52:004:003 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
           should abstain from fornication:

52:004:004 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
           sanctification and honour;

52:004:005 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
           know not God:

52:004:006 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
           because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
           have forewarned you and testified.

52:004:007 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
           holiness.

52:004:008 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
           hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

52:004:009 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
           you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

52:004:010 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
           Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
           and more;

52:004:011 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
           and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

52:004:012 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
           that ye may have lack of nothing.

52:004:013 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
           them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
           which have no hope.

52:004:014 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
           also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

52:004:015 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
           which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
           not prevent them which are asleep.

52:004:016 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
           with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:
           and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

52:004:017 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
           with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
           shall we ever be with the Lord.

52:004:018 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

52:005:001 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
           that I write unto you.

52:005:002 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
           cometh as a thief in the night.

52:005:003 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
           destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
           child; and they shall not escape.

52:005:004 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
           overtake you as a thief.

52:005:005 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
           we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

52:005:006 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
           be sober.

52:005:007 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be
           drunken are drunken in the night.

52:005:008 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
           breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of
           salvation.

52:005:009 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
           salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

52:005:010 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
           live together with him.

52:005:011 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
           even as also ye do.

52:005:012 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
           you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

52:005:013 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
           And be at peace among yourselves.

52:005:014 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
           comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward
           all men.

52:005:015 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever
           follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
           men.

52:005:016 Rejoice evermore.

52:005:017 Pray without ceasing.

52:005:018 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
           Christ Jesus concerning you.

52:005:019 Quench not the Spirit.

52:005:020 Despise not prophesyings.

52:005:021 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

52:005:022 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

52:005:023 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
           your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
           unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

52:005:024 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

52:005:025 Brethren, pray for us.

52:005:026 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

52:005:027 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
           the holy brethren.

52:005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Book 53        2 Thessalonians

53:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
           Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

53:001:002 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
           Jesus Christ.

53:001:003 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
           meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
           charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

53:001:004 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
           your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
           tribulations that ye endure:

53:001:005 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
           that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
           ye also suffer:

53:001:006 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
           tribulation to them that trouble you;

53:001:007 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
           shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

53:001:008 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
           and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

53:001:009 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
           presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

53:001:010 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
           admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
           you was believed) in that day.

53:001:011 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
           count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good
           pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

53:001:012 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
           you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

53:002:001 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

53:002:002 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
           spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day
           of Christ is at hand.

53:002:003 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
           come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
           sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

53:002:004 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
           God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
           temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

53:002:005 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
           these things?

53:002:006 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
           his time.

53:002:007 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
           letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

53:002:008 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
           consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
           the brightness of his coming:

53:002:009 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
           power and signs and lying wonders,

53:002:010 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
           perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
           they might be saved.

53:002:011 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
           they should believe a lie:

53:002:012 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
           had pleasure in unrighteousness.

53:002:013 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
           beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
           chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
           and belief of the truth:

53:002:014 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
           glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

53:002:015 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which
           ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

53:002:016 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
           which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation
           and good hope through grace,

53:002:017 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
           work.

53:003:001 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
           have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

53:003:002 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
           for all men have not faith.

53:003:003 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
           from evil.

53:003:004 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
           do and will do the things which we command you.

53:003:005 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
           the patient waiting for Christ.

53:003:006 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
           walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
           received of us.

53:003:007 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
           not ourselves disorderly among you;

53:003:008 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
           with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
           chargeable to any of you:

53:003:009 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
           ensample unto you to follow us.

53:003:010 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
           any would not work, neither should he eat.

53:003:011 For we hear that there are some which walk among you
           disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

53:003:012 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
           Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
           bread.

53:003:013 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

53:003:014 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
           man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

53:003:015 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

53:003:016 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
           means. The Lord be with you all.

53:003:017 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
           in every epistle: so I write.

53:003:018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Book 54        1 Timothy

54:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
           Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

54:001:002 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and
           peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

54:001:003 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
           Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
           other doctrine,

54:001:004 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
           minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
           faith: so do.

54:001:005 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,
           and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

54:001:006 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
           jangling;

54:001:007 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what
           they say, nor whereof they affirm.

54:001:008 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

54:001:009 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
           but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
           sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
           murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

54:001:010 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
           mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and
           if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
           doctrine;

54:001:011 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
           committed to my trust.

54:001:012 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
           that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

54:001:013 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
           but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

54:001:014 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
           and love which is in Christ Jesus.

54:001:015 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
           Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
           chief.

54:001:016 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
           Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern
           to them which should hereafter believe on him to life
           everlasting.

54:001:017 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
           God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

54:001:018 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
           prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
           mightest war a good warfare;

54:001:019 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
           away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

54:001:020 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto
           Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

54:002:001 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
           prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all
           men;

54:002:002 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead
           a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

54:002:003 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
           Saviour;

54:002:004 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
           knowledge of the truth.

54:002:005 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
           the man Christ Jesus;

54:002:006 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
           time.

54:002:007 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak
           the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles
           in faith and verity.

54:002:008 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
           hands, without wrath and doubting.

54:002:009 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
           apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided
           hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

54:002:010 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
           works.

54:002:011 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

54:002:012 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
           the man, but to be in silence.

54:002:013 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

54:002:014 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
           the transgression.

54:002:015 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
           continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

54:003:001 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
           he desireth a good work.

54:003:002 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
           vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt
           to teach;

54:003:003 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
           patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

54:003:004 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
           subjection with all gravity;

54:003:005 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he
           take care of the church of God?)

54:003:006 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
           condemnation of the devil.

54:003:007 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
           lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

54:003:008 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not
           given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

54:003:009 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

54:003:010 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
           office of a deacon, being found blameless.

54:003:011 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
           faithful in all things.

54:003:012 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
           children and their own houses well.

54:003:013 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
           to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
           which is in Christ Jesus.

54:003:014 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
           shortly:

54:003:015 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
           to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of
           the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

54:003:016 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
           was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
           angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
           received up into glory.

54:004:001 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
           some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
           spirits, and doctrines of devils;

54:004:002 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
           with a hot iron;

54:004:003 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
           which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
           them which believe and know the truth.

54:004:004 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused,
           if it be received with thanksgiving:

54:004:005 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

54:004:006 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
           shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
           words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
           attained.

54:004:007 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
           rather unto godliness.

54:004:008 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is
           profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
           now is, and of that which is to come.

54:004:009 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

54:004:010 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
           trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men,
           specially of those that believe.

54:004:011 These things command and teach.

54:004:012 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
           believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
           faith, in purity.

54:004:013 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
           doctrine.

54:004:014 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
           prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

54:004:015 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that
           thy profiting may appear to all.

54:004:016 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
           them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
           that hear thee.

54:005:001 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the
           younger men as brethren;

54:005:002 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
           purity.

54:005:003 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

54:005:004 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
           first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for
           that is good and acceptable before God.

54:005:005 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God,
           and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

54:005:006 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

54:005:007 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

54:005:008 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of
           his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
           infidel.

54:005:009 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore
           years old, having been the wife of one man.

54:005:010 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
           children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
           saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
           diligently followed every good work.

54:005:011 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
           wanton against Christ, they will marry;

54:005:012 Having damnation, because they have cast off their first
           faith.

54:005:013 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house
           to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
           speaking things which they ought not.

54:005:014 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
           guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
           reproachfully.

54:005:015 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

54:005:016 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them
           relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may
           relieve them that are widows indeed.

54:005:017 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
           honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

54:005:018 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
           treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his
           reward.

54:005:019 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
           three witnesses.

54:005:020 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

54:005:021 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
           elect angels, that thou observe these things without
           preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

54:005:022 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
           men's sins: keep thyself pure.

54:005:023 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
           sake and thine often infirmities.

54:005:024 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
           and some men they follow after.

54:005:025 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand;
           and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

54:006:001 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
           masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his
           doctrine be not blasphemed.

54:006:002 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
           them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
           because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
           benefit. These things teach and exhort.

54:006:003 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
           words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
           doctrine which is according to godliness;

54:006:004 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
           strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
           surmisings,

54:006:005 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of
           the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such
           withdraw thyself.

54:006:006 But godliness with contentment is great gain.

54:006:007 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we
           can carry nothing out.

54:006:008 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

54:006:009 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
           and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
           destruction and perdition.

54:006:010 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
           some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
           pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

54:006:011 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
           righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

54:006:012 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
           whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
           profession before many witnesses.

54:006:013 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
           things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate
           witnessed a good confession;

54:006:014 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable,
           until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

54:006:015 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
           Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

54:006:016 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
           can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom
           be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

54:006:017 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
           highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
           God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

54:006:018 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
           distribute, willing to communicate;

54:006:019 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
           the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

54:006:020 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
           profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely
           so called:

54:006:021 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace
           be with thee. Amen.
Book 55        2 Timothy

55:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according
           to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

55:001:002 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace,
           from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

55:001:003 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
           conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in
           my prayers night and day;

55:001:004 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that
           I may be filled with joy;

55:001:005 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in
           thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy
           mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

55:001:006 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift
           of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

55:001:007 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power,
           and of love, and of a sound mind.

55:001:008 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
           nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the
           afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

55:001:009 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
           according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
           grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
           began,

55:001:010 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
           Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
           immortality to light through the gospel:

55:001:011 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a
           teacher of the Gentiles.

55:001:012 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I
           am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am
           persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
           unto him against that day.

55:001:013 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of
           me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

55:001:014 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
           Ghost which dwelleth in us.

55:001:015 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned
           away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

55:001:016 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
           refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

55:001:017 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently,
           and found me.

55:001:018 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
           that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at
           Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

55:002:001 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
           Christ Jesus.

55:002:002 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
           witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be
           able to teach others also.

55:002:003 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
           Christ.

55:002:004 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
           this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a
           soldier.

55:002:005 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
           except he strive lawfully.

55:002:006 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
           fruits.

55:002:007 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
           all things.

55:002:008 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised
           from the dead according to my gospel:

55:002:009 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds;
           but the word of God is not bound.

55:002:010 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they
           may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
           eternal glory.

55:002:011 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
           also live with him:

55:002:012 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he
           also will deny us:

55:002:013 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
           himself.

55:002:014 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before
           the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to
           the subverting of the hearers.

55:002:015 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that
           needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

55:002:016 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase
           unto more ungodliness.

55:002:017 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
           and Philetus;

55:002:018 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the
           resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

55:002:019 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
           seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one
           that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

55:002:020 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
           silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and
           some to dishonour.

55:002:021 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a
           vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use,
           and prepared unto every good work.

55:002:022 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
           charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure
           heart.

55:002:023 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they
           do gender strifes.

55:002:024 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
           unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

55:002:025 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
           peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
           the truth;

55:002:026 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
           devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

55:003:001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
           come.

55:003:002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
           boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
           unthankful, unholy,

55:003:003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
           incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

55:003:004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than
           lovers of God;

55:003:005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
           from such turn away.

55:003:006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
           captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers
           lusts,

55:003:007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
           truth.

55:003:008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
           resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
           the faith.

55:003:009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
           manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

55:003:010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
           purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

55:003:011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
           Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of
           them all the Lord delivered me.

55:003:012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
           persecution.

55:003:013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
           deceiving, and being deceived.

55:003:014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and
           hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

55:003:015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
           which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
           which is in Christ Jesus.

55:003:016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
           profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
           instruction in righteousness:

55:003:017 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto
           all good works.

55:004:001 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
           who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and
           his kingdom;

55:004:002 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
           rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

55:004:003 For the time will come when they will not endure sound
           doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
           themselves teachers, having itching ears;

55:004:004 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
           be turned unto fables.

55:004:005 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
           of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

55:004:006 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
           is at hand.

55:004:007 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
           kept the faith:

55:004:008 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
           which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
           day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
           appearing.

55:004:009 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

55:004:010 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
           and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
           unto Dalmatia.

55:004:011 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for
           he is profitable to me for the ministry.

55:004:012 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

55:004:013 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
           bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

55:004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward
           him according to his works:

55:004:015 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
           words.

55:004:016 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
           me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

55:004:017 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
           that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all
           the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth
           of the lion.

55:004:018 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
           preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for
           ever and ever. Amen.

55:004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

55:004:020 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
           sick.

55:004:021 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
           and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

55:004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
           Amen.
Book 56        Titus

56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
           according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
           of the truth which is after godliness;

56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
           before the world began;

56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
           which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
           our Saviour;

56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
           and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
           Saviour.

56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
           in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
           every city, as I had appointed thee:

56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
           children not accused of riot or unruly.

56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
           selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
           given to filthy lucre;

56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
           holy, temperate;

56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
           may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
           the gainsayers.

56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
           specially they of the circumcision:

56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
           teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
           Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
           may be sound in the faith;

56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
           that turn from the truth.

56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
           defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
           and conscience is defiled.

56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
           being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
           reprobate.

56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
           in charity, in patience.

56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
           holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
           of good things;

56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
           husbands, to love their children,

56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
           their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
           doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
           contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
           you.

56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
           please them well in all things; not answering again;

56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
           adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
           all men,

56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
           should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
           world;

56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
           the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
           iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
           of good works.

56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
           Let no man despise thee.

56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
           to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
           shewing all meekness unto all men.

56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
           deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
           and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
           man appeared,

56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
           according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
           regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
           Saviour;

56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
           according to the hope of eternal life.

56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
           affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
           be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
           profitable unto men.

56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
           and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
           vain.

56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
           admonition reject;

56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
           condemned of himself.

56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
           to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
           winter.

56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
           diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

56:003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
           uses, that they be not unfruitful.

56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
           the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
Book 57        Philemon

57:001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
           unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

57:001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
           and to the church in thy house:

57:001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
           Jesus Christ.

57:001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

57:001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
           Jesus, and toward all saints;

57:001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
           the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
           Christ Jesus.

57:001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
           bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

57:001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
           thee that which is convenient,

57:001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
           as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

57:001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
           bonds:

57:001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
           profitable to thee and to me:

57:001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
           mine own bowels:

57:001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
           have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

57:001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
           should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

57:001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
           shouldest receive him for ever;

57:001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
           specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
           flesh, and in the Lord?

57:001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

57:001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
           account;

57:001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
           albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
           own self besides.

57:001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
           bowels in the Lord.

57:001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
           that thou wilt also do more than I say.

57:001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
           your prayers I shall be given unto you.

57:001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

57:001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

57:001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Book 58        Hebrews

58:001:001 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
           past unto the fathers by the prophets,

58:001:002 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
           hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
           worlds;

58:001:003 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
           of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
           power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
           right hand of the Majesty on high:

58:001:004 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
           inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

58:001:005 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
           Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
           him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

58:001:006 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
           world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

58:001:007 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and
           his ministers a flame of fire.

58:001:008 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
           ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy
           kingdom.

58:001:009 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
           God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
           above thy fellows.

58:001:010 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
           the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:

58:001:011 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
           old as doth a garment;

58:001:012 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
           changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

58:001:013 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
           right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

58:001:014 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
           for them who shall be heirs of salvation?

58:002:001 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
           which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

58:002:002 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
           transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
           reward;

58:002:003 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
           at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
           unto us by them that heard him;

58:002:004 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
           and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
           according to his own will?

58:002:005 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to
           come, whereof we speak.

58:002:006 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
           that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
           visitest him?

58:002:007 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
           him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
           thy hands:

58:002:008 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
           that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
           is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
           under him.

58:002:009 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
           for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour;
           that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

58:002:010 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
           all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
           captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

58:002:011 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
           all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
           brethren,

58:002:012 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
           of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

58:002:013 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
           the children which God hath given me.

58:002:014 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
           blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
           through death he might destroy him that had the power of
           death, that is, the devil;

58:002:015 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
           lifetime subject to bondage.

58:002:016 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
           took on him the seed of Abraham.

58:002:017 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
           his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
           priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
           the sins of the people.

58:002:018 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
           to succour them that are tempted.

58:003:001 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
           consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
           Jesus;

58:003:002 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
           faithful in all his house.

58:003:003 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
           inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
           than the house.

58:003:004 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
           things is God.

58:003:005 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant,
           for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

58:003:006 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if
           we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
           unto the end.

58:003:007 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
           voice,

58:003:008 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
           temptation in the wilderness:

58:003:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
           forty years.

58:003:010 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
           do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

58:003:011 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

58:003:012 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
           of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

58:003:013 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
           any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

58:003:014 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
           of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

58:003:015 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
           your hearts, as in the provocation.

58:003:016 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
           that came out of Egypt by Moses.

58:003:017 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
           that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

58:003:018 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
           but to them that believed not?

58:003:019 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

58:004:001 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
           entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
           of it.

58:004:002 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
           the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
           faith in them that heard it.

58:004:003 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
           I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
           although the works were finished from the foundation of the
           world.

58:004:004 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
           wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

58:004:005 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

58:004:006 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
           and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
           of unbelief:

58:004:007 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
           after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear
           his voice, harden not your hearts.

58:004:008 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
           have spoken of another day.

58:004:009 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

58:004:010 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
           his own works, as God did from his.

58:004:011 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
           fall after the same example of unbelief.

58:004:012 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
           any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
           soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
           discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

58:004:013 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
           sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
           him with whom we have to do.

58:004:014 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
           into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
           profession.

58:004:015 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
           the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
           like as we are, yet without sin.

58:004:016 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
           may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

58:005:001 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
           in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and
           sacrifices for sins:

58:005:002 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
           out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
           infirmity.

58:005:003 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
           himself, to offer for sins.

58:005:004 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
           called of God, as was Aaron.

58:005:005 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
           priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
           have I begotten thee.

58:005:006 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
           after the order of Melchisedec.

58:005:007 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
           and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
           was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
           feared;

58:005:008 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
           which he suffered;

58:005:009 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
           salvation unto all them that obey him;

58:005:010 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

58:005:011 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
           seeing ye are dull of hearing.

58:005:012 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
           that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
           oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
           not of strong meat.

58:005:013 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
           righteousness: for he is a babe.

58:005:014 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
           those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
           discern both good and evil.

58:006:001 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
           let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
           of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

58:006:002 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
           resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

58:006:003 And this will we do, if God permit.

58:006:004 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
           have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
           the Holy Ghost,

58:006:005 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
           world to come,

58:006:006 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
           seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
           put him to an open shame.

58:006:007 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
           it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
           dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

58:006:008 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
           nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.

58:006:009 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
           things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

58:006:010 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
           love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have
           ministered to the saints, and do minister.

58:006:011 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
           to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

58:006:012 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
           faith and patience inherit the promises.

58:006:013 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
           by no greater, he sware by himself,

58:006:014 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I
           will multiply thee.

58:006:015 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
           promise.

58:006:016 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
           confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

58:006:017 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
           promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
           oath:

58:006:018 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
           God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
           for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

58:006:019 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
           stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

58:006:020 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an
           high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

58:007:001 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
           God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
           kings, and blessed him;

58:007:002 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
           interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
           of Salem, which is, King of peace;

58:007:003 Without father, without mother, without descent, having
           neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
           the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

58:007:004 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the
           patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

58:007:005 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
           office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
           the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
           though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

58:007:006 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
           of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

58:007:007 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the
           better.

58:007:008 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth
           them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

58:007:009 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
           tithes in Abraham.

58:007:010 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
           met him.

58:007:011 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
           under it the people received the law,) what further need was
           there that another priest should rise after the order of
           Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

58:007:012 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
           change also of the law.

58:007:013 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
           tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

58:007:014 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
           tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

58:007:015 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
           of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

58:007:016 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
           after the power of an endless life.

58:007:017 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
           of Melchisedec.

58:007:018 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
           before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

58:007:019 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
           better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

58:007:020 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:

58:007:021 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an
           oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
           repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
           Melchisedec:)

58:007:022 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

58:007:023 And they truly were many priests, because they were not
           suffered to continue by reason of death:

58:007:024 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
           priesthood.

58:007:025 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
           come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
           intercession for them.

58:007:026 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
           undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
           heavens;

58:007:027 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
           sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:
           for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

58:007:028 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but
           the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son,
           who is consecrated for evermore.

58:008:001 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We
           have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
           throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

58:008:002 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
           the Lord pitched, and not man.

58:008:003 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and
           sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
           somewhat also to offer.

58:008:004 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing
           that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

58:008:005 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
           Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
           tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things
           according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

58:008:006 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
           much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
           established upon better promises.

58:008:007 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
           place have been sought for the second.

58:008:008 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
           saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house
           of Israel and with the house of Judah:

58:008:009 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
           in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of
           the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant,
           and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

58:008:010 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
           Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
           into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be
           to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

58:008:011 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every
           man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me,
           from the least to the greatest.

58:008:012 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
           sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

58:008:013 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
           Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish
           away.

58:009:001 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
           service, and a worldly sanctuary.

58:009:002 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
           candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called
           the sanctuary.

58:009:003 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
           Holiest of all;

58:009:004 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
           overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
           that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of
           the covenant;

58:009:005 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of
           which we cannot now speak particularly.

58:009:006 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
           always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
           God.

58:009:007 But into the second went the high priest alone once every
           year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
           the errors of the people:

58:009:008 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
           of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
           tabernacle was yet standing:

58:009:009 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
           offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him
           that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

58:009:010 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
           carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
           reformation.

58:009:011 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,
           by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
           that is to say, not of this building;

58:009:012 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
           he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
           eternal redemption for us.

58:009:013 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
           heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
           the flesh:

58:009:014 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
           eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
           conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

58:009:015 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
           that by means of death, for the redemption of the
           transgressions that were under the first testament, they which
           are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

58:009:016 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
           death of the testator.

58:009:017 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it
           is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

58:009:018 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
           blood.

58:009:019 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
           according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of
           goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled
           both the book, and all the people,

58:009:020 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
           enjoined unto you.

58:009:021 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
           the vessels of the ministry.

58:009:022 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
           without shedding of blood is no remission.

58:009:023 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
           heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
           themselves with better sacrifices than these.

58:009:024 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
           hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven
           itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

58:009:025 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
           entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

58:009:026 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
           the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he
           appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

58:009:027 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
           the judgment:

58:009:028 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
           them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
           sin unto salvation.

58:010:001 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
           the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
           which they offered year by year continually make the comers
           thereunto perfect.

58:010:002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
           that the worshippers once purged should have had no more
           conscience of sins.

58:010:003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
           sins every year.

58:010:004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
           should take away sins.

58:010:005 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
           and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
           me:

58:010:006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
           pleasure.

58:010:007 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is
           written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

58:010:008 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
           and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
           therein; which are offered by the law;

58:010:009 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
           the first, that he may establish the second.

58:010:010 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
           the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

58:010:011 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
           oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
           sins:

58:010:012 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for
           ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

58:010:013 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
           footstool.

58:010:014 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
           sanctified.

58:010:015 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
           he had said before,

58:010:016 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
           days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,
           and in their minds will I write them;

58:010:017 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

58:010:018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
           sin.

58:010:019 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
           by the blood of Jesus,

58:010:020 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
           through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

58:010:021 And having an high priest over the house of God;

58:010:022 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
           having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
           bodies washed with pure water.

58:010:023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
           (for he is faithful that promised;)

58:010:024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
           good works:

58:010:025 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
           manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
           more, as ye see the day approaching.

58:010:026 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
           knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
           sins,

58:010:027 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
           indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

58:010:028 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
           three witnesses:

58:010:029 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
           worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
           counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
           sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
           Spirit of grace?

58:010:030 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
           will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall
           judge his people.

58:010:031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
           God.

58:010:032 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye
           were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

58:010:033 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches
           and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of
           them that were so used.

58:010:034 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
           spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in
           heaven a better and an enduring substance.

58:010:035 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
           recompence of reward.

58:010:036 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
           will of God, ye might receive the promise.

58:010:037 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
           will not tarry.

58:010:038 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
           soul shall have no pleasure in him.

58:010:039 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
           them that believe to the saving of the soul.

58:011:001 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
           of things not seen.

58:011:002 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

58:011:003 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
           word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of
           things which do appear.

58:011:004 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
           Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
           testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

58:011:005 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
           and was not found, because God had translated him: for before
           his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

58:011:006 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
           cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
           rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

58:011:007 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
           moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
           by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
           righteousness which is by faith.

58:011:008 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
           which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and
           he went out, not knowing whither he went.

58:011:009 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
           country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
           heirs with him of the same promise:

58:011:010 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder
           and maker is God.

58:011:011 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
           seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age,
           because she judged him faithful who had promised.

58:011:012 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
           so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand
           which is by the sea shore innumerable.

58:011:013 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
           having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and
           embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
           pilgrims on the earth.

58:011:014 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
           country.

58:011:015 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from
           whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
           returned.

58:011:016 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
           wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
           hath prepared for them a city.

58:011:017 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
           that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
           son,

58:011:018 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

58:011:019 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
           dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

58:011:020 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
           come.

58:011:021 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
           Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

58:011:022 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing
           of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his
           bones.

58:011:023 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
           parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were
           not afraid of the king's commandment.

58:011:024 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be
           called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

58:011:025 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
           than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

58:011:026 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
           treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of
           the reward.

58:011:027 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
           for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

58:011:028 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
           blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

58:011:029 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which
           the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

58:011:030 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
           compassed about seven days.

58:011:031 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
           not, when she had received the spies with peace.

58:011:032 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
           of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of
           David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

58:011:033 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
           obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.

58:011:034 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
           out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
           turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

58:011:035 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
           were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might
           obtain a better resurrection:

58:011:036 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,
           moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

58:011:037 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
           slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and
           goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

58:011:038 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
           and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

58:011:039 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
           received not the promise:

58:011:040 God having provided some better thing for us, that they
           without us should not be made perfect.

58:012:001 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
           cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
           which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience
           the race that is set before us,

58:012:002 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
           for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
           despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
           throne of God.

58:012:003 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
           against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

58:012:004 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

58:012:005 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
           as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of
           the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:

58:012:006 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
           son whom he receiveth.

58:012:007 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
           for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

58:012:008 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
           then are ye bastards, and not sons.

58:012:009 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
           us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
           subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

58:012:010 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
           pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
           his holiness.

58:012:011 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
           grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
           fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

58:012:012 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
           knees;

58:012:013 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame
           be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

58:012:014 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
           shall see the Lord:

58:012:015 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
           any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby
           many be defiled;

58:012:016 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who
           for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

58:012:017 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
           the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
           repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

58:012:018 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
           that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
           tempest,

58:012:019 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which
           voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be
           spoken to them any more:

58:012:020 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so
           much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or
           thrust through with a dart:

58:012:021 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly
           fear and quake:)

58:012:022 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
           living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
           company of angels,

58:012:023 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
           written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the
           spirits of just men made perfect,

58:012:024 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
           blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of
           Abel.

58:012:025 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
           not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not
           we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:

58:012:026 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
           saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
           heaven.

58:012:027 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
           things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those
           things which cannot be shaken may remain.

58:012:028 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
           have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence
           and godly fear:

58:012:029 For our God is a consuming fire.

58:013:001 Let brotherly love continue.

58:013:002 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
           entertained angels unawares.

58:013:003 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
           which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

58:013:004 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
           whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

58:013:005 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
           with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never
           leave thee, nor forsake thee.

58:013:006 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will
           not fear what man shall do unto me.

58:013:007 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
           unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the
           end of their conversation.

58:013:008 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

58:013:009 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it
           is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not
           with meats, which have not profited them that have been
           occupied therein.

58:013:010 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
           serve the tabernacle.

58:013:011 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
           the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without
           the camp.

58:013:012 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
           his own blood, suffered without the gate.

58:013:013 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
           his reproach.

58:013:014 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

58:013:015 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
           continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
           his name.

58:013:016 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
           sacrifices God is well pleased.

58:013:017 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
           for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account,
           that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
           unprofitable for you.

58:013:018 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
           things willing to live honestly.

58:013:019 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be
           restored to you the sooner.

58:013:020 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
           Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the
           blood of the everlasting covenant,

58:013:021 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in
           you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus
           Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

58:013:022 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation:
           for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

58:013:023 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
           if he come shortly, I will see you.

58:013:024 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the
           saints. They of Italy salute you.

58:013:025 Grace be with you all. Amen.
Book 59        James

59:001:001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
           twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

59:001:002 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
           temptations;

59:001:003 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

59:001:004 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
           and entire, wanting nothing.

59:001:005 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
           all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
           him.

59:001:006 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
           wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
           tossed.

59:001:007 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
           the Lord.

59:001:008 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

59:001:009 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

59:001:010 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of
           the grass he shall pass away.

59:001:011 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
           withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
           grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
           man fade away in his ways.

59:001:012 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
           tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
           promised to them that love him.

59:001:013 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
           God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

59:001:014 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
           lust, and enticed.

59:001:015 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
           when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

59:001:016 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

59:001:017 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
           cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
           variableness, neither shadow of turning.

59:001:018 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
           should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

59:001:019 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
           hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

59:001:020 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

59:001:021 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
           naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word,
           which is able to save your souls.

59:001:022 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
           your own selves.

59:001:023 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
           unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

59:001:024 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
           forgetteth what manner of man he was.

59:001:025 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
           continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
           doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

59:001:026 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
           his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
           is vain.

59:001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
           To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
           keep himself unspotted from the world.

59:002:001 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
           Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

59:002:002 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
           in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
           raiment;

59:002:003 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
           say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the
           poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

59:002:004 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
           of evil thoughts?

59:002:005 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of
           this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
           hath promised to them that love him?

59:002:006 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
           and draw you before the judgment seats?

59:002:007 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
           called?

59:002:008 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
           shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

59:002:009 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
           convinced of the law as transgressors.

59:002:010 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
           point, he is guilty of all.

59:002:011 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
           kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou
           art become a transgressor of the law.

59:002:012 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
           law of liberty.

59:002:013 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
           mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

59:002:014 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
           faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

59:002:015 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

59:002:016 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
           and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
           which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

59:002:017 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

59:002:018 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
           thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
           my works.

59:002:019 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
           devils also believe, and tremble.

59:002:020 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
           dead?

59:002:021 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
           offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

59:002:022 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
           faith made perfect?

59:002:023 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
           God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was
           called the Friend of God.

59:002:024 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
           faith only.

59:002:025 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
           when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out
           another way?

59:002:026 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
           works is dead also.

59:003:001 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
           receive the greater condemnation.

59:003:002 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
           word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
           whole body.

59:003:003 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
           us; and we turn about their whole body.

59:003:004 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
           driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
           small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

59:003:005 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
           things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

59:003:006 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
           tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
           setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
           hell.

59:003:007 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
           of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
           mankind:

59:003:008 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
           deadly poison.

59:003:009 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
           we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

59:003:010 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
           brethren, these things ought not so to be.

59:003:011 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
           bitter?

59:003:012 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
           vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
           fresh.

59:003:013 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
           shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
           wisdom.

59:003:014 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
           not, and lie not against the truth.

59:003:015 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
           sensual, devilish.

59:003:016 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
           evil work.

59:003:017 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
           peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and
           good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

59:003:018 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
           make peace.

59:004:001 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
           hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

59:004:002 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
           obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

59:004:003 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
           consume it upon your lusts.

59:004:004 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the
           friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
           therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

59:004:005 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
           dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

59:004:006 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
           the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

59:004:007 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
           will flee from you.

59:004:008 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
           hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

59:004:009 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
           to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

59:004:010 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
           you up.

59:004:011 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil
           of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the
           law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
           not a doer of the law, but a judge.

59:004:012 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
           art thou that judgest another?

59:004:013 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
           such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and
           get gain:

59:004:014 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is
           your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
           time, and then vanisheth away.

59:004:015 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and
           do this, or that.

59:004:016 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is
           evil.

59:004:017 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
           him it is sin.

59:005:001 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that
           shall come upon you.

59:005:002 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

59:005:003 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall
           be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were
           fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

59:005:004 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
           fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
           cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of
           the Lord of sabaoth.

59:005:005 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye
           have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

59:005:006 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
           you.

59:005:007 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
           Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
           earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the
           early and latter rain.

59:005:008 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of
           the Lord draweth nigh.

59:005:009 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be
           condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

59:005:010 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name
           of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of
           patience.

59:005:011 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
           patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the
           Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

59:005:012 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
           heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but
           let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
           condemnation.

59:005:013 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let
           him sing psalms.

59:005:014 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
           church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
           the name of the Lord:

59:005:015 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
           shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
           be forgiven him.

59:005:016 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
           that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a
           righteous man availeth much.

59:005:017 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
           prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on
           the earth by the space of three years and six months.

59:005:018 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
           brought forth her fruit.

59:005:019 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
           him;

59:005:020 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
           error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide
           a multitude of sins.
Book 60        1 Peter

60:001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
           throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

60:001:002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
           through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
           sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
           peace, be multiplied.

60:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
           according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
           lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

60:001:004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
           fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

60:001:005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
           ready to be revealed in the last time.

60:001:006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
           be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

60:001:007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
           gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
           found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
           Jesus Christ:

60:001:008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
           not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
           of glory:

60:001:009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
           souls.

60:001:010 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
           diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
           you:

60:001:011 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
           which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
           the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

60:001:012 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
           us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
           you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
           Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels
           desire to look into.

60:001:013 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
           to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
           revelation of Jesus Christ;

60:001:014 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
           the former lusts in your ignorance:

60:001:015 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
           manner of conversation;

60:001:016 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

60:001:017 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
           judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
           sojourning here in fear:

60:001:018 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
           corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
           conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

60:001:019 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
           blemish and without spot:

60:001:020 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
           world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

60:001:021 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
           dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
           God.

60:001:022 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
           through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
           that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

60:001:023 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
           incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth
           for ever.

60:001:024 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
           flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
           falleth away:

60:001:025 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
           word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

60:002:001 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
           hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,

60:002:002 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
           may grow thereby:

60:002:003 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

60:002:004 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
           men, but chosen of God, and precious,

60:002:005 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
           holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
           to God by Jesus Christ.

60:002:006 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
           in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
           believeth on him shall not be confounded.

60:002:007 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
           which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed,
           the same is made the head of the corner,

60:002:008 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
           which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also
           they were appointed.

60:002:009 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
           nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
           praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
           marvellous light;

60:002:010 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
           of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
           mercy.

60:002:011 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
           abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

60:002:012 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
           whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
           good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
           visitation.

60:002:013 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
           sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

60:002:014 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
           punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
           well.

60:002:015 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
           silence the ignorance of foolish men:

60:002:016 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
           maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

60:002:017 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
           king.

60:002:018 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
           to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

60:002:019 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
           endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

60:002:020 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
           ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
           suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
           God.

60:002:021 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
           for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
           steps:

60:002:022 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

60:002:023 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
           he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
           righteously:

60:002:024 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
           that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
           by whose stripes ye were healed.

60:002:025 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
           the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

60:003:001 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
           that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
           be won by the conversation of the wives;

60:003:002 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

60:003:003 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
           the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

60:003:004 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
           not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
           which is in the sight of God of great price.

60:003:005 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
           trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
           their own husbands:

60:003:006 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
           ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
           amazement.

60:003:007 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
           giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
           being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
           be not hindered.

60:003:008 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
           another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

60:003:009 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
           contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
           that ye should inherit a blessing.

60:003:010 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
           his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

60:003:011 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
           ensue it.

60:003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
           are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
           against them that do evil.

60:003:013 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
           which is good?

60:003:014 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
           and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

60:003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
           to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
           hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

60:003:016 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
           you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
           your good conversation in Christ.

60:003:017 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
           well doing, than for evil doing.

60:003:018 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
           unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
           the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

60:003:019 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

60:003:020 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
           of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
           preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
           water.

60:003:021 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
           (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
           answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
           of Jesus Christ:

60:003:022 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
           angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

60:004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
           arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
           suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

60:004:002 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
           flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

60:004:003 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
           the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
           lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
           idolatries:

60:004:004 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
           same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

60:004:005 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
           and the dead.

60:004:006 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
           are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
           flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

60:004:007 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
           and watch unto prayer.

60:004:008 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
           for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

60:004:009 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

60:004:010 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
           one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

60:004:011 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any
           man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
           giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
           Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
           Amen.

60:004:012 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
           is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

60:004:013 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
           sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
           glad also with exceeding joy.

60:004:014 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
           the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part
           he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

60:004:015 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as
           an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

60:004:016 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
           but let him glorify God on this behalf.

60:004:017 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
           God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
           them that obey not the gospel of God?

60:004:018 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
           ungodly and the sinner appear?

60:004:019 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
           commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
           unto a faithful Creator.

60:005:001 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
           and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
           of the glory that shall be revealed:

60:005:002 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
           thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
           lucre, but of a ready mind;

60:005:003 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being
           ensamples to the flock.

60:005:004 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
           crown of glory that fadeth not away.

60:005:005 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
           all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
           humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
           humble.

60:005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
           he may exalt you in due time:

60:005:007 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

60:005:008 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
           roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

60:005:009 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
           afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
           world.

60:005:010 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
           glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
           make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

60:005:011 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

60:005:012 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
           written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
           true grace of God wherein ye stand.

60:005:013 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
           saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

60:005:014 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
           all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Book 61        2 Peter

61:001:001 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
           that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
           righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

61:001:002 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
           of God, and of Jesus our Lord,

61:001:003 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
           that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
           him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

61:001:004 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
           promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
           nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
           through lust.

61:001:005 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
           virtue; and to virtue knowledge;

61:001:006 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and
           to patience godliness;

61:001:007 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
           charity.

61:001:008 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that
           ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
           our Lord Jesus Christ.

61:001:009 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
           off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

61:001:010 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
           calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall
           never fall:

61:001:011 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
           into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
           Christ.

61:001:012 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
           remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
           established in the present truth.

61:001:013 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to
           stir you up by putting you in remembrance;

61:001:014 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even
           as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

61:001:015 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease
           to have these things always in remembrance.

61:001:016 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
           made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
           Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

61:001:017 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
           there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This
           is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

61:001:018 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
           with him in the holy mount.

61:001:019 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
           well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
           place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
           hearts:

61:001:020 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
           any private interpretation.

61:001:021 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
           holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

61:002:001 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
           there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
           bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
           them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

61:002:002 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
           the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

61:002:003 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
           merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time
           lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

61:002:004 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
           down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
           be reserved unto judgment;

61:002:005 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
           person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood
           upon the world of the ungodly;

61:002:006 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
           condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto
           those that after should live ungodly;

61:002:007 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
           the wicked:

61:002:008 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
           hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
           unlawful deeds;)

61:002:009 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
           and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
           punished:

61:002:010 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
           uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they,
           selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

61:002:011 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring
           not railing accusation against them before the Lord.

61:002:012 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
           destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
           and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;

61:002:013 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that
           count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and
           blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while
           they feast with you;

61:002:014 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
           beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with
           covetous practices; cursed children:

61:002:015 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
           following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the
           wages of unrighteousness;

61:002:016 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with
           man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

61:002:017 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
           tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

61:002:018 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they
           allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much
           wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live
           in error.

61:002:019 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
           servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the
           same is he brought in bondage.

61:002:020 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
           through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
           they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end
           is worse with them than the beginning.

61:002:021 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
           righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from
           the holy commandment delivered unto them.

61:002:022 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
           The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
           washed to her wallowing in the mire.

61:003:001 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both
           which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

61:003:002 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
           by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the
           apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

61:003:003 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
           scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

61:003:004 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
           fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
           beginning of the creation.

61:003:005 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
           God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
           water and in the water:

61:003:006 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
           perished:

61:003:007 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
           are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
           judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

61:003:008 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
           is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
           one day.

61:003:009 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
           count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
           that any should perish, but that all should come to
           repentance.

61:003:010 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
           the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
           the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
           the works that are therein shall be burned up.

61:003:011 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
           manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
           godliness,

61:003:012 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
           wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
           elements shall melt with fervent heat?

61:003:013 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
           heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

61:003:014 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
           diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot,
           and blameless.

61:003:015 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation;
           even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom
           given unto him hath written unto you;

61:003:016 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things;
           in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
           that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the
           other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

61:003:017 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before,
           beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
           wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

61:003:018 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
           Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.
           Amen.
Book 62        1 John

62:001:001 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
           we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
           hands have handled, of the Word of life;

62:001:002 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
           witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with
           the Father, and was manifested unto us;)

62:001:003 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
           also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is
           with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

62:001:004 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

62:001:005 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and
           declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness
           at all.

62:001:006 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
           darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

62:001:007 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
           fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
           Son cleanseth us from all sin.

62:001:008 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
           truth is not in us.

62:001:009 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
           our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

62:001:010 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
           word is not in us.

62:002:001 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
           not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
           Jesus Christ the righteous:

62:002:002 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's
           only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

62:002:003 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
           commandments.

62:002:004 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
           is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

62:002:005 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
           perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

62:002:006 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
           even as he walked.

62:002:007 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
           commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old
           commandment is the word which ye have heard from the
           beginning.

62:002:008 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true
           in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true
           light now shineth.

62:002:009 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
           in darkness even until now.

62:002:010 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
           none occasion of stumbling in him.

62:002:011 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
           darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
           darkness hath blinded his eyes.

62:002:012 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are
           forgiven you for his name's sake.

62:002:013 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
           from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye
           have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little
           children, because ye have known the Father.

62:002:014 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him
           that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
           men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in
           you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

62:002:015 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
           If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
           him.

62:002:016 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
           lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father,
           but is of the world.

62:002:017 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
           doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

62:002:018 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
           that antichrist shall come, even now are there many
           antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

62:002:019 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
           had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us:
           but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they
           were not all of us.

62:002:020 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
           things.

62:002:021 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
           because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

62:002:022 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He
           is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

62:002:023 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he
           that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

62:002:024 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
           beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning
           shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in
           the Father.

62:002:025 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
           life.

62:002:026 These things have I written unto you concerning them that
           seduce you.

62:002:027 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in
           you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
           anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
           lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

62:002:028 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
           appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him
           at his coming.

62:002:029 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
           doeth righteousness is born of him.

62:003:001 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
           that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
           knoweth us not, because it knew him not.

62:003:002 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
           appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
           appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

62:003:003 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
           even as he is pure.

62:003:004 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
           is the transgression of the law.

62:003:005 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
           in him is no sin.

62:003:006 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
           not seen him, neither known him.

62:003:007 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
           righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

62:003:008 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
           from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
           manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

62:003:009 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
           remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
           God.

62:003:010 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
           the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
           neither he that loveth not his brother.

62:003:011 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
           we should love one another.

62:003:012 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
           And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,
           and his brother's righteous.

62:003:013 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

62:003:014 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
           love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in
           death.

62:003:015 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
           no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

62:003:016 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
           life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
           brethren.

62:003:017 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
           need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
           dwelleth the love of God in him?

62:003:018 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
           tongue; but in deed and in truth.

62:003:019 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
           our hearts before him.

62:003:020 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
           and knoweth all things.

62:003:021 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
           toward God.

62:003:022 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
           commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
           sight.

62:003:023 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
           name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave
           us commandment.

62:003:024 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he
           in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
           Spirit which he hath given us.

62:004:001 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
           they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
           the world.

62:004:002 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
           that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

62:004:003 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
           in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of
           antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and
           even now already is it in the world.

62:004:004 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them:
           because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the
           world.

62:004:005 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
           the world heareth them.

62:004:006 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not
           of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and
           the spirit of error.

62:004:007 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
           every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

62:004:008 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

62:004:009 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
           God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
           live through him.

62:004:010 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
           and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

62:004:011 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
           another.

62:004:012 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
           dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

62:004:013 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
           hath given us of his Spirit.

62:004:014 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
           to be the Saviour of the world.

62:004:015 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
           dwelleth in him, and he in God.

62:004:016 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
           God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
           God in him.

62:004:017 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
           the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this
           world.

62:004:018 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
           because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect
           in love.

62:004:019 We love him, because he first loved us.

62:004:020 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
           liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
           how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

62:004:021 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God
           love his brother also.

62:005:001 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
           and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that
           is begotten of him.

62:005:002 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
           God, and keep his commandments.

62:005:003 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:
           and his commandments are not grievous.

62:005:004 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
           is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

62:005:005 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
           that Jesus is the Son of God?

62:005:006 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
           not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
           Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

62:005:007 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
           the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

62:005:008 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit,
           and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

62:005:009 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
           greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath
           testified of his Son.

62:005:010 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
           himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar;
           because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

62:005:011 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
           life, and this life is in his Son.

62:005:012 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
           of God hath not life.

62:005:013 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name
           of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life,
           and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

62:005:014 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
           ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

62:005:015 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know
           that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

62:005:016 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death,
           he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not
           unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
           shall pray for it.

62:005:017 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

62:005:018 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that
           is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
           toucheth him not.

62:005:019 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
           wickedness.

62:005:020 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
           understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are
           in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the
           true God, and eternal life.

62:005:021 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
Book 63        2 John

63:001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
           the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
           the truth;

63:001:002 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
           us for ever.

63:001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
           from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
           and love.

63:001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
           truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

63:001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
           commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
           beginning, that we love one another.

63:001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
           the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
           should walk in it.

63:001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
           that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
           an antichrist.

63:001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
           have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

63:001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
           Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
           Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

63:001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
           receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

63:001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
           deeds.

63:001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
           paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
           face, that our joy may be full.

63:001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
Book 64        3 John

64:001:001 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
           truth.

64:001:002 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
           be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

64:001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
           of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
           truth.

64:001:004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
           truth.

64:001:005 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
           brethren, and to strangers;

64:001:006 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
           whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
           sort, thou shalt do well:

64:001:007 Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
           nothing of the Gentiles.

64:001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
           fellowhelpers to the truth.

64:001:009 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
           the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

64:001:010 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
           doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
           content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
           brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
           of the church.

64:001:011 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
           good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
           hath not seen God.

64:001:012 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
           itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
           record is true.

64:001:013 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
           write unto thee:

64:001:014 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
           to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
           friends by name.
Book 65        Jude

65:001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
           them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
           Jesus Christ, and called:

65:001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

65:001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
           common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
           exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
           which was once delivered unto the saints.

65:001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
           of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
           grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
           Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

65:001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
           this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
           land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

65:001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
           their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
           under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

65:001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
           manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
           strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
           vengeance of eternal fire.

65:001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
           dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

65:001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
           disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
           a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

65:001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
           what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
           they corrupt themselves.

65:001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
           greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
           the gainsaying of Core.

65:001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
           with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are
           without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
           withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

65:001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
           wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
           for ever.

65:001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
           saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
           saints,

65:001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
           ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
           ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which
           ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

65:001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
           lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
           men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

65:001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
           of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

65:001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
           time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

65:001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
           Spirit.

65:001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
           faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

65:001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
           our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

65:001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

65:001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
           hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

65:001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
           present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
           exceeding joy,

65:001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
           dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
Book 66        Revelation

66:001:001 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
           shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
           and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
           John:

66:001:002 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
           Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

66:001:003 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
           this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
           therein: for the time is at hand.

66:001:004 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto
           you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
           to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his
           throne;

66:001:005 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
           first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
           earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
           his own blood,

66:001:006 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to
           him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

66:001:007 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
           and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
           shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

66:001:008 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
           Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
           Almighty.

66:001:009 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
           tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
           was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God,
           and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

66:001:010 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
           great voice, as of a trumpet,

66:001:011 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
           What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
           churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
           unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
           Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

66:001:012 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
           turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

66:001:013 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
           Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
           about the paps with a golden girdle.

66:001:014 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
           and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

66:001:015 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
           furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

66:001:016 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
           went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the
           sun shineth in his strength.

66:001:017 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
           his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the
           first and the last:

66:001:018 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
           evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

66:001:019 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which
           are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

66:001:020 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
           hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
           the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks
           which thou sawest are the seven churches.

66:002:001 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things
           saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
           walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

66:002:002 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
           thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried
           them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
           them liars:

66:002:003 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast
           laboured, and hast not fainted.

66:002:004 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
           left thy first love.

66:002:005 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
           and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
           and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
           repent.

66:002:006 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
           Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

66:002:007 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
           tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

66:002:008 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
           saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

66:002:009 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
           rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are
           Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

66:002:010 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
           devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be
           tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
           faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

66:002:011 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
           second death.

66:002:012 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
           saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

66:002:013 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's
           seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my
           faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful
           martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

66:002:014 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
           them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
           cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
           things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

66:002:015 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
           Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

66:002:016 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
           against them with the sword of my mouth.

66:002:017 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
           hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
           stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
           receiveth it.

66:002:018 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
           things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a
           flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

66:002:019 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
           patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
           first.

66:002:020 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
           sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
           prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
           fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

66:002:021 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
           repented not.

66:002:022 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
           adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent
           of their deeds.

66:002:023 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
           shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:
           and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

66:002:024 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
           have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of
           Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

66:002:025 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

66:002:026 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to
           him will I give power over the nations:

66:002:027 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
           potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of
           my Father.

66:002:028 And I will give him the morning star.

66:002:029 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:001 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
           saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
           stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou
           livest, and art dead.

66:003:002 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
           ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before
           God.

66:003:003 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
           fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will
           come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I
           will come upon thee.

66:003:004 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
           their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they
           are worthy.

66:003:005 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
           raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
           life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
           his angels.

66:003:006 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:007 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
           things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath
           the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and
           shutteth, and no man openeth;

66:003:008 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,
           and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and
           hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

66:003:009 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
           they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make
           them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I
           have loved thee.

66:003:010 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
           keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
           all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

66:003:011 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that
           no man take thy crown.

66:003:012 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my
           God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him
           the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which
           is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God:
           and I will write upon him my new name.

66:003:013 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:003:014 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
           These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
           the beginning of the creation of God;

66:003:015 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
           thou wert cold or hot.

66:003:016 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
           will spue thee out of my mouth.

66:003:017 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
           have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,
           and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

66:003:018 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
           mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
           clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
           and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

66:003:019 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
           and repent.

66:003:020 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
           voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
           with him, and he with me.

66:003:021 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
           throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
           Father in his throne.

66:003:022 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
           the churches.

66:004:001 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
           and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
           talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
           thee things which must be hereafter.

66:004:002 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was
           set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

66:004:003 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
           stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in
           sight like unto an emerald.

66:004:004 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
           upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
           in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

66:004:005 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
           voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the
           throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

66:004:006 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
           crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
           throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.

66:004:007 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
           a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
           fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

66:004:008 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
           they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and
           night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was,
           and is, and is to come.

66:004:009 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
           that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

66:004:010 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
           the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
           cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

66:004:011 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
           power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
           they are and were created.

66:005:001 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
           book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven
           seals.

66:005:002 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
           worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

66:005:003 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
           was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

66:005:004 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
           to read the book, neither to look thereon.

66:005:005 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
           Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
           to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

66:005:006 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
           four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
           it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
           are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

66:005:007 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
           that sat upon the throne.

66:005:008 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
           twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
           them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
           prayers of saints.

66:005:009 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
           book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
           hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
           tongue, and people, and nation;

66:005:010 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
           reign on the earth.

66:005:011 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
           the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
           them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
           thousands;

66:005:012 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
           receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
           honour, and glory, and blessing.

66:005:013 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
           under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
           in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
           power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
           Lamb for ever and ever.

66:005:014 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
           fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

66:006:001 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,
           as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts
           saying, Come and see.

66:006:002 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him
           had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth
           conquering, and to conquer.

66:006:003 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
           beast say, Come and see.

66:006:004 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was
           given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth,
           and that they should kill one another: and there was given
           unto him a great sword.

66:006:005 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
           say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he
           that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

66:006:006 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
           measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for
           a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

66:006:007 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
           the fourth beast say, Come and see.

66:006:008 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
           on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was
           given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill
           with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the
           beasts of the earth.

66:006:009 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar
           the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
           the testimony which they held:

66:006:010 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
           holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
           them that dwell on the earth?

66:006:011 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was
           said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
           until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that
           should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

66:006:012 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
           was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth
           of hair, and the moon became as blood;

66:006:013 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig
           tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
           wind.

66:006:014 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled
           together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
           their places.

66:006:015 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
           men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
           bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in
           the rocks of the mountains;

66:006:016 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us
           from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
           wrath of the Lamb:

66:006:017 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able
           to stand?

66:007:001 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four
           corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
           that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,
           nor on any tree.

66:007:002 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
           seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
           four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the
           sea,

66:007:003 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
           till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
           foreheads.

66:007:004 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there
           were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
           tribes of the children of Israel.

66:007:005 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
           of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad
           were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:006 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
           of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:007 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
           tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:008 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
           tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
           Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

66:007:009 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
           could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
           tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
           with white robes, and palms in their hands;

66:007:010 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
           which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

66:007:011 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
           elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on
           their faces, and worshipped God,

66:007:012 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and
           thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our
           God for ever and ever. Amen.

66:007:013 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
           which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

66:007:014 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
           These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
           washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
           Lamb.

66:007:015 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
           and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne
           shall dwell among them.

66:007:016 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
           shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

66:007:017 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
           them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and
           God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

66:008:001 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
           heaven about the space of half an hour.

66:008:002 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
           were given seven trumpets.

66:008:003 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
           censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he
           should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden
           altar which was before the throne.

66:008:004 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
           the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

66:008:005 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
           altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and
           thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

66:008:006 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
           themselves to sound.

66:008:007 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire
           mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
           third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was
           burnt up.

66:008:008 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
           burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of
           the sea became blood;

66:008:009 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and
           had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
           destroyed.

66:008:010 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
           heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third
           part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;

66:008:011 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third
           part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
           waters, because they were made bitter.

66:008:012 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
           was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third
           part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened,
           and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night
           likewise.

66:008:013 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
           heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the
           inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the
           trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

66:009:001 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven
           unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless
           pit.

66:009:002 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out
           of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and
           the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

66:009:003 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and
           unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
           power.

66:009:004 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
           of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but
           only those men which have not the seal of God in their
           foreheads.

66:009:005 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
           that they should be tormented five months: and their torment
           was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

66:009:006 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
           and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

66:009:007 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared
           unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like
           gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

66:009:008 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were
           as the teeth of lions.

66:009:009 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;
           and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of
           many horses running to battle.

66:009:010 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings
           in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

66:009:011 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
           bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,
           but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

66:009:012 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more
           hereafter.

66:009:013 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
           horns of the golden altar which is before God,

66:009:014 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the
           four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.

66:009:015 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an
           hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the
           third part of men.

66:009:016 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
           thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.

66:009:017 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
           them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and
           brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of
           lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and
           brimstone.

66:009:018 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire,
           and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of
           their mouths.

66:009:019 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for
           their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
           them they do hurt.

66:009:020 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
           yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should
           not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass,
           and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor
           walk:

66:009:021 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
           sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

66:010:001 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
           with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face
           was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

66:010:002 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his
           right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,

66:010:003 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when
           he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

66:010:004 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
           about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
           me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and
           write them not.

66:010:005 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
           earth lifted up his hand to heaven,

66:010:006 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
           heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and
           the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which
           are therein, that there should be time no longer:

66:010:007 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
           shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished,
           as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

66:010:008 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,
           and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the
           hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the
           earth.

66:010:009 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the
           little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and
           it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth
           sweet as honey.

66:010:010 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
           up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I
           had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

66:010:011 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
           peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

66:011:001 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
           stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the
           altar, and them that worship therein.

66:011:002 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
           measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the
           holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.

66:011:003 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
           prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed
           in sackcloth.

66:011:004 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks
           standing before the God of the earth.

66:011:005 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
           mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt
           them, he must in this manner be killed.

66:011:006 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days
           of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to
           blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as
           they will.

66:011:007 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
           that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war
           against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

66:011:008 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great
           city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also
           our Lord was crucified.

66:011:009 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
           shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall
           not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

66:011:010 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,
           and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because
           these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

66:011:011 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
           entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great
           fear fell upon them which saw them.

66:011:012 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,
           Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and
           their enemies beheld them.

66:011:013 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
           part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men
           seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave
           glory to the God of heaven.

66:011:014 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
           quickly.

66:011:015 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
           heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the
           kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
           for ever and ever.

66:011:016 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
           seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

66:011:017 Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art,
           and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
           great power, and hast reigned.

66:011:018 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
           time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
           shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to
           the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
           shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

66:011:019 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
           in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
           lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake,
           and great hail.

66:012:001 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
           with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
           crown of twelve stars:

66:012:002 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
           pained to be delivered.

66:012:003 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
           great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
           crowns upon his heads.

66:012:004 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and
           did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the
           woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child
           as soon as it was born.

66:012:005 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
           with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and
           to his throne.

66:012:006 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
           prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
           two hundred and threescore days.

66:012:007 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
           against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

66:012:008 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
           heaven.

66:012:009 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called
           the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
           cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
           him.

66:012:010 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
           salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
           power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
           down, which accused them before our God day and night.

66:012:011 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
           word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto
           the death.

66:012:012 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe
           to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil
           is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
           that he hath but a short time.

66:012:013 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
           persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

66:012:014 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that
           she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she
           is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the
           face of the serpent.

66:012:015 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
           the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
           flood.

66:012:016 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
           mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of
           his mouth.

66:012:017 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
           with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
           God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

66:013:001 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
           out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
           horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

66:013:002 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his
           feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
           a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
           great authority.

66:013:003 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
           his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
           the beast.

66:013:004 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the
           beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto
           the beast? who is able to make war with him?

66:013:005 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
           blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
           and two months.

66:013:006 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
           his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

66:013:007 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
           overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and
           tongues, and nations.

66:013:008 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
           names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
           from the foundation of the world.

66:013:009 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

66:013:010 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he
           that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
           Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

66:013:011 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
           had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

66:013:012 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
           and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship
           the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

66:013:013 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
           from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

66:013:014 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of
           those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the
           beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they
           should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a
           sword, and did live.

66:013:015 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
           that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that
           as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
           killed.

66:013:016 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
           and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
           foreheads:

66:013:017 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,
           or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

66:013:018 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
           number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his
           number is Six hundred threescore and six.

66:014:001 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
           with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his
           Father's name written in their foreheads.

66:014:002 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
           and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
           harpers harping with their harps:

66:014:003 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
           before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
           that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
           were redeemed from the earth.

66:014:004 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
           virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
           goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
           firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

66:014:005 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
           fault before the throne of God.

66:014:006 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
           everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
           earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
           people,

66:014:007 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
           the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

66:014:008 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
           is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
           of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

66:014:009 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
           If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
           mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

66:014:010 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
           poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;
           and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
           presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

66:014:011 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
           and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and
           his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

66:014:012 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
           the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

66:014:013 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
           are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith
           the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
           works do follow them.

66:014:014 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
           sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
           crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

66:014:015 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
           voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
           reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest
           of the earth is ripe.

66:014:016 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the
           earth; and the earth was reaped.

66:014:017 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,
           he also having a sharp sickle.

66:014:018 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power
           over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
           sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
           clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully
           ripe.

66:014:019 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and
           gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
           winepress of the wrath of God.

66:014:020 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
           out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the
           space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

66:015:001 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
           angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up
           the wrath of God.

66:015:002 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and
           them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
           image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,
           stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

66:015:003 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
           song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,
           Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
           saints.

66:015:004 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for
           thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship
           before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

66:015:005 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
           tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:

66:015:006 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
           plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their
           breasts girded with golden girdles.

66:015:007 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
           golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
           ever.

66:015:008 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
           and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the
           temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were
           fulfilled.

66:016:001 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the
           seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the
           wrath of God upon the earth.

66:016:002 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;
           and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
           had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his
           image.

66:016:003 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
           became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died
           in the sea.

66:016:004 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
           fountains of waters; and they became blood.

66:016:005 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
           Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast
           judged thus.

66:016:006 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
           hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

66:016:007 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
           Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

66:016:008 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and
           power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

66:016:009 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name
           of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented
           not to give him glory.

66:016:010 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
           beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed
           their tongues for pain,

66:016:011 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and
           their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

66:016:012 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
           Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
           the kings of the east might be prepared.

66:016:013 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
           mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and
           out of the mouth of the false prophet.

66:016:014 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
           forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
           gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

66:016:015 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
           keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
           shame.

66:016:016 And he gathered them together into a place called in the
           Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

66:016:017 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
           there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
           throne, saying, It is done.

66:016:018 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
           was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon
           the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

66:016:019 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the
           cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in
           remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine
           of the fierceness of his wrath.

66:016:020 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

66:016:021 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every
           stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
           because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was
           exceeding great.

66:017:001 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven
           vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will
           shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth
           upon many waters:

66:017:002 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
           and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the
           wine of her fornication.

66:017:003 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
           saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names
           of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

66:017:004 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
           decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
           golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of
           her fornication:

66:017:005 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
           GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

66:017:006 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
           with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I
           wondered with great admiration.

66:017:007 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I
           will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that
           carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

66:017:008 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend
           out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they
           that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not
           written in the book of life from the foundation of the world,
           when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

66:017:009 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are
           seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

66:017:010 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and
           the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must
           continue a short space.

66:017:011 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
           is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

66:017:012 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
           received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one
           hour with the beast.

66:017:013 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
           unto the beast.

66:017:014 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
           overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and
           they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

66:017:015 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
           whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
           tongues.

66:017:016 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these
           shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked,
           and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

66:017:017 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
           agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words
           of God shall be fulfilled.

66:017:018 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
           reigneth over the kings of the earth.

66:018:001 And after these things I saw another angel come down from
           heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
           his glory.

66:018:002 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
           great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
           devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
           unclean and hateful bird.

66:018:003 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
           fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
           fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed
           rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

66:018:004 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
           her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that
           ye receive not of her plagues.

66:018:005 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
           her iniquities.

66:018:006 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her
           double according to her works: in the cup which she hath
           filled fill to her double.

66:018:007 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
           much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart,
           I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

66:018:008 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
           mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
           fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

66:018:009 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
           lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for
           her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

66:018:010 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,
           alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one
           hour is thy judgment come.

66:018:011 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
           for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

66:018:012 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and
           of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
           and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all
           manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron,
           and marble,

66:018:013 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and
           wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
           sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

66:018:014 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
           thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed
           from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

66:018:015 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
           shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and
           wailing,

66:018:016 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in
           fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and
           precious stones, and pearls!

66:018:017 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
           shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as
           many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

66:018:018 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What
           city is like unto this great city!

66:018:019 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
           wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made
           rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her
           costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

66:018:020 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
           prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

66:018:021 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
           cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that
           great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more
           at all.

66:018:022 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
           trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no
           craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more
           in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more
           at all in thee;

66:018:023 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
           and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be
           heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
           men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations
           deceived.

66:018:024 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
           of all that were slain upon the earth.

66:019:001 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
           heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour,
           and power, unto the Lord our God:

66:019:002 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged
           the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her
           fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
           hand.

66:019:003 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever
           and ever.

66:019:004 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down
           and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen;
           Alleluia.

66:019:005 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
           all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and
           great.

66:019:006 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as
           the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
           thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent
           reigneth.

66:019:007 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
           marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
           ready.

66:019:008 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
           linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the
           righteousness of saints.

66:019:009 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
           unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me,
           These are the true sayings of God.

66:019:010 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
           See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
           brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for
           the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

66:019:011 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
           sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in
           righteousness he doth judge and make war.

66:019:012 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
           crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he
           himself.

66:019:013 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
           name is called The Word of God.

66:019:014 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
           horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

66:019:015 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
           should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
           iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and
           wrath of Almighty God.

66:019:016 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
           KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

66:019:017 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a
           loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of
           heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of
           the great God;

66:019:018 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains,
           and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of
           them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and
           bond, both small and great.

66:019:019 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
           armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on
           the horse, and against his army.

66:019:020 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
           wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
           had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped
           his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire
           burning with brimstone.

66:019:021 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
           the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the
           fowls were filled with their flesh.

66:020:001 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of
           the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

66:020:002 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
           Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

66:020:003 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set
           a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,
           till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he
           must be loosed a little season.

66:020:004 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
           given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
           beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
           and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
           neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in
           their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
           years.

66:020:005 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
           years were finished. This is the first resurrection.

66:020:006 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
           resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
           shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
           him a thousand years.

66:020:007 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
           out of his prison,

66:020:008 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
           quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together
           to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

66:020:009 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
           the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
           came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

66:020:010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
           fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are,
           and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

66:020:011 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
           whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
           found no place for them.

66:020:012 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
           books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the
           book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
           which were written in the books, according to their works.

66:020:013 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
           hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
           judged every man according to their works.

66:020:014 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is
           the second death.

66:020:015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
           cast into the lake of fire.

66:021:001 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
           and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
           sea.

66:021:002 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
           God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her
           husband.

66:021:003 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
           tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
           and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
           them, and be their God.

66:021:004 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
           shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
           shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
           away.

66:021:005 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
           things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are
           true and faithful.

66:021:006 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
           beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of
           the fountain of the water of life freely.

66:021:007 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
           God, and he shall be my son.

66:021:008 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
           murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
           all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth
           with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

66:021:009 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
           seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with
           me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the
           Lamb's wife.

66:021:010 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
           mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
           descending out of heaven from God,

66:021:011 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
           most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

66:021:012 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
           the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
           the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

66:021:013 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the
           south three gates; and on the west three gates.

66:021:014 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
           the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

66:021:015 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
           city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

66:021:016 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as
           the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
           thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height
           of it are equal.

66:021:017 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and
           four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of
           the angel.

66:021:018 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
           was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

66:021:019 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
           with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
           jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the
           fourth, an emerald;

66:021:020 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
           chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth,
           a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an
           amethyst.

66:021:021 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate
           was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as
           it were transparent glass.

66:021:022 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
           Lamb are the temple of it.

66:021:023 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
           shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
           is the light thereof.

66:021:024 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the
           light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory
           and honour into it.

66:021:025 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
           shall be no night there.

66:021:026 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
           it.

66:021:027 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
           defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a
           lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

66:022:001 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
           crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

66:022:002 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
           river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of
           fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
           the tree were for the healing of the nations.

66:022:003 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
           the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

66:022:004 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their
           foreheads.

66:022:005 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
           neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:
           and they shall reign for ever and ever.

66:022:006 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and
           the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto
           his servants the things which must shortly be done.

66:022:007 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
           of the prophecy of this book.

66:022:008 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
           heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the
           angel which shewed me these things.

66:022:009 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
           fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them
           which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

66:022:010 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
           this book: for the time is at hand.

66:022:011 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
           filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
           him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
           still.

66:022:012 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
           every man according as his work shall be.

66:022:013 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
           the last.

66:022:014 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
           right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates
           into the city.

66:022:015 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
           murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a
           lie.

66:022:016 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things
           in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and
           the bright and morning star.

66:022:017 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
           heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
           whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

66:022:018 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
           prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
           God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this
           book:

66:022:019 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
           this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
           life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
           written in this book.

66:022:020 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
           Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

66:022:021 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
